Codebase Cloned\n- Repo: `robertknowles/ignito-project-kit` cloned to workspace\n- Path: `/Users/robertknowles/.openclaw/workspace/ignito-project-kit/`\n\n### 2. Full Codebase Audit Written\n- File: `memory/knowledge/proppath-codebase-audit.md` (committed + pushed)\n- Covers: Growth assumptions, purchase prices, rental yields, LVR defaults, client output, and all 3 system tests\n\n### 3. Roadmap Lite (The Investors Agency) Analysed\n- Rob provided screenshot + YouTube walkthrough transcript\n- This is the PRIMARY competitor to benchmark against (not InvestorKit as previously assumed)\n- Key finding: Rob confirmed PropPath **already has** sell-down scenario, realistic pricing defaults, and cash contribution per property\n\n---\n\n## Key Audit Findings (Summary)\n\n### 🔴 Must Fix Before BA Rollout\n1. **Vacancy rate = 0%** on most property types → overstates cashflow\n2. **APRA 3% serviceability buffer missing** → approves loans banks would reject\n3. **Borrowing capacity stub** (`calculateUpdatedBorrowingCapacity` returns base unchanged) → properties 4-6 show feasible when they aren't\n4. **DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratio not modelled** → Roadmap Lite blocks at 6x DTI, PropPath has no DTI check at all\n\n### 🟡 Should Fix\n5. Units/Commercial defaulting to **High growth** → change to Medium\n6. Purchase prices **~12-18 months stale**\n7. **88% LVR default** → change to 80%\n8. **Existing portfolio growth hardcoded at 3%** → raise to 5-6%\n\n### 🟢 Good As-Is\n- Stamp duty (correct bracket rates all states)\n- LMI (correctly uses lower of purchase price/valuation)\n- Tiered growth curve architecture\n- Strategy narrative (Serviceability Valve detection is smart)\n- Cascade model architecture\n- Sell-down retirement scenario ✅ (Rob confirmed this exists)\n- Realistic pricing defaults ✅ (Rob confirmed)\n- Cash contribution per property ✅ (Rob confirmed)\n\n---\n\n## Critical Missing Context (Next Session Priority)\n\n**Rob is providing frontend screenshots next session.**\nGoal: Understand the actual UI so we can map UI → code accurately before fixing anything.\n\nKey questions to answer with screenshots:\n1. How does the client actually see/interact with the 3 system tests (deposit/borrowing/serviceability)?\n2. Is DSR/DTI displayed anywhere in the current UI?\n3. What does the sell-down retirement scenario actually look like?\n4. How are the growth tiers (High/Medium/Low) presented to the BA?\n5. What does the \"borrowing power\" display look like vs Roadmap Lite's $1.56M prominent display?\n\n---\n\n## Files Written This Session\n| File | Contents |\n|------|----------|\n| `memory/knowledge/proppath-codebase-audit.md` | Full audit — all 3 audits, red/yellow/green findings |\n| `ignito-project-kit/` | Cloned codebase (not committed to workspace) |\n\n---\n\n## Next Actions (Pick Up Here)\n\n### Step 1 — Frontend Screenshot Tour (Rob providing)\nRob will send screenshots of the PropPath UI. Map each screen to the relevant code files.\n\n### Step 2 — Fix the 4 Red Items\nPriority order:\n1. Add APRA 3% buffer to borrowing capacity calculation (`calculateBorrowingCapacity.ts`)\n2. Fix borrowing capacity stub (`metricsCalculator.ts` → `calculateUpdatedBorrowingCapacity`)\n3. Add DTI check to guardrail validator (`guardrailValidator.ts`)\n4. Set vacancy rates to minimum 2% in `property-defaults.json`\n\n### Step 3 — Fix Yellow Items\n- Update `property-defaults.json`: Units/Commercial → Medium growth\n- Update purchase prices to 2025 market\n- Change LVR default from 88% → 80%\n\n---\n\n## Competitor Intelligence\n- **Roadmap Lite (The Investors Agency)** = direct competitor, most similar product\n  - 3 growth tiers: Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive\n  - Blocks on DTI at 6x (APRA standard)\n  - $650k default purchase price, 5.5% yield = $688/wk\n  - Sell-down retirement slider (PropPath has equivalent)\n  - Cash contribution per property (PropPath has equivalent)\n- **InvestorKit** = target first customer, uses Gameplans in sessions\n- **APS/School of Property** = long-term average 6-8% growth teaching\n\n---\n\n## Git Status\n- Audit file committed and pushed to `robertknowles/openclaw-workspace`\n- `ignito-project-kit` is local only (separate repo, not pushed to workspace)\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771967949554}}
