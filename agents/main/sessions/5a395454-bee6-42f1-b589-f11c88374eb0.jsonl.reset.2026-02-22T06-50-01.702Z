Competitor Research — COMPLETED ✅\nFull competitor doc saved to: `memory/knowledge/competitor_software.md`\n\n**Key findings:**\n- **Open BA** — $129–$299/user/month. AI sourcing + outreach platform. COMPLEMENTARY to PropPath (they do sourcing, we do planning)\n- **HTAG Analytics** — $295.95/month Professional plan. Suburb analytics + portfolio modelling. Open BA integrates with HTAG.\n- **RealEstateInvestar** — $99–$248/month. Individual investor tool, NOT a BA tool. Minimal overlap.\n- **SystemsDU** — Zoho-based BA CRM. 300+ BA clients AU/NZ. Open BA integrates with SystemsDU.\n- **BA-ICON** — Dedicated BA CRM. \"World's first.\" Commission tracking, client portal. Pricing opaque.\n- **Gameplans** — Strategy session software. Pricing opaque.\n\n**PropPath positioning confirmed:** Sits ABOVE the entire stack as the ongoing portfolio roadmap layer. No competitor solves this.\n\n### 2. Google Sheet Updated ✅\n- ResearchPipeline tab: 5 competitor rows added (Open BA, HTAG, RealEstateInvestar, SystemsDU, BA-ICON)\n\n### 3. Property Investment Knowledge Build — STARTED (incomplete)\nRob pivoted focus from competitors to property investment fundamentals.\n\n**Research gathered so far (not yet written to file):**\n- Pivot Property Buyers 5-phase portfolio model (very useful for PropPath):\n  1. **Accumulation** — buy blue-chip properties, suburb selection, top 2% asset selection\n  2. **Expedite** — manufacture equity via renos/development, increase yields\n  3. **Maturation** — hold, let market work, LVR decreases\n  4. **Consolidation** — sell down residential, reinvest into commercial cash-flow assets\n  5. **Debt Reduction** — build passive income portfolio, financial freedom\n  Source: pivotpb.com.au/services/investment-property/\n\n- **Equity leverage mechanism** (Altus Financial):\n  - Buy property → value grows → refinance at 80% LVR → extract equity → use as deposit for next property\n  - Cash purchase option if equity large enough\n  - Key: each property must be cash flow positive to sustain the chain\n  Source: altusfinancial.com.au\n\n- **Australian property fundamentals** (Antloans):\n  - Sydney/Melbourne = high prices, steady capital growth, competitive\n  - Regional = higher yields, lower prices, slower growth\n  - Key metrics: rental yield, capital growth, cash flow, LVR, vacancy rates\n  - Tax: negative gearing, CGT, depreciation deductions\n  - Strategies: buy-to-let, buy-to-sell (flip), long-term hold\n  Source: antloans.com.au\n\n- **InvestorKit process** (AU's #1 BA 2023 & 2024):\n  - \"Portfolio Mapping Session\" is their key product — clients get 3 properties in 3 years on average\n  - 5-step process: Discovery → Comprehensive Assessment → Tailored Strategy → Acquisition → Post-settlement support\n  Source: investorkit.com.au\n\n- **Pivot Portfolio Planner** — explicitly maps:\n  - Number of properties needed\n  - Cash contributions required\n  - Equity projections\n  - Expected yields\n  — This is essentially what PropPath should do visually.\n\n---\n\n## Key Strategic Insight This Session\n\n**The \"5-Phase Portfolio Journey\" is the PropPath roadmap:**\n1. Accumulation (buy 1st-3rd properties)\n2. Expedite (manufacture equity, renos)\n3. Maturation (hold, let grow)\n4. Consolidation (sell down, shift to commercial)\n5. Debt Reduction / Passive Income\n\n**PropPath should visualise exactly this journey for each client.**\n\n---\n\n## Exact Next Actions (Resume Here)\n1. **Write `memory/knowledge/property-investment/01-fundamentals.md`** — consolidate all research from this session into a structured knowledge doc\n2. **Research: advanced strategies** — debt recycling, manufacturing equity, trusts/structures, negative gearing mechanics\n3. **Research: how BAs actually run portfolio planning sessions** — what questions do they ask, what outputs do they give clients\n4. **Research: what does a \"property portfolio roadmap\" look like** — find examples from leading BAs\n5. **Build the PropPath feature map** — based on what BAs actually need to show clients\n6. Update Google Sheet TaskManager with this research task\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions / Blockers\n- What does a BA's portfolio planning session output actually look like? (PDF? Spreadsheet? Verbal?)\n- What's the typical client profile for a BA? (income, savings, goals, timeline)\n- How many properties do most BA clients end up buying? What's the typical journey length?\n- Does PropPath need to integrate with mortgage broker tools / borrowing capacity calculators?\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771742257674}}

(PDF? Spreadsheet? Verbal?)\n- What's the typical client profile?

Ideally, it would be best if you held onto the investments through market cycles. Tolerance for Risk: This strategy involves using debt to invest, which can amplify both gains and losses. A well-diversified portfolio is essential to spread risk and withstand market fluctuations.

Debt Recycling\n\n**What it is:** Converting non-deductible home loan debt into tax-deductible investment debt.\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Make extra repayments on home mortgage (reduces non-deductible debt)\n2. Redraw or refinance that equity\n3. Invest the borrowed funds into income-producing assets (shares, ETFs, property trusts, investment property)\n4. Claim interest on investment loan as a tax deduction\n5. Use investment income + tax savings to repeat the cycle\n\n**Key benefit:** You're simultaneously:\n- Paying off your home faster\n- Building an investment portfolio\n- Reducing your tax bill\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Must have a home with equity (owner-occupier debt to convert)\n- Investment must produce assessable income (rent, dividends)\n- Long-term strategy — works over 10-20+ years\n- Needs income protection insurance + emergency fund as safeguards\n\n**PropPath relevance:** Could be a Phase 1→2 strategy visualisation. Show clients how their PPOR equity converts into portfolio equity over time.\n\n*Source: duotax.com.au*\n\n---\n\n## 2. Manufacturing Equity (Equity Acceleration)\n\n**What it is:** Forcing property value growth rather than waiting for natural market appreciation.\n\n**Methods:**\n- **Renovation:** Cosmetic or structural improvements that add more value than they cost\n- **Subdivision:** Splitting land to create additional titles/dwellings\n- **Development:** Building new dwellings on existing land (granny flat, duplex, townhouses)\n- **Rezoning plays:** Buying in areas pre-rezoning, benefiting from uplift\n\n**Why BAs use this:** Accelerates the equity leverage cycle. Instead of waiting 5-7 years for market growth, manufacture $100k+ in equity in 12-18 months, then refinance and buy again.\n\n**Risk:** Renovation over-capitalisation (spend more than you add in value). Must know the suburb ceiling.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Ownership Structures\n\n### Individual / Joint Names\n- Simplest structure\n- CGT discount available (50% if held 12+ months)\n- Negative gearing offsets personal income\n\n### Family Trust (Discretionary Trust)\n- **Pros:** Income splitting across family members, asset protection, flexibility in distributing gains\n- **Cons:** Cannot negative gear (losses stay in trust, can't offset personal income), setup and ongoing costs\n- Best for: positive cash flow portfolios, high-net-worth clients protecting assets\n\n### Company\n- 30% flat tax rate (25% for small base companies)\n- No CGT discount\n- Rarely used for buy-and-hold property\n- Better for: development/trading strategies\n\n### SMSF (Self-Managed Super Fund)\n- 15% tax rate in accumulation phase\n- 0% tax in pension phase\n- Can borrow via LRBA (Limited Recourse Borrowing Arrangement)\n- Restrictions: can't renovate with borrowed funds, must be \"investment quality\" property\n- Best for: later-stage investors approaching retirement\n\n**PropPath relevance:** Clients may hold properties across multiple structures. PropPath should be able to show a portfolio across entities, not just individual names.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Rentvesting\n\n**What it is:** Renting where you want to live, buying investment property where the numbers work.\n\n**Why it's popular:** Allows investors to enter the market in high-growth suburbs without needing to live there. PPORs in Sydney/Melbourne are often poor investment assets.\n\n**Trade-offs:**\n- No CGT discount on PPOR (since they don't own one)\n- Psychological: renting feels less \"stable\" for some clients\n- Flexibility: can buy in best-opportunity markets regardless of where you live\n\n---\n\n## 5. The BRRRR Method\n\n**Buy → Renovate → Rent → Refinance → Repeat**\n\n1. **Buy** undervalued or cosmetically distressed property\n2. **Renovate** to increase value and rental appeal\n3. **Rent** at market rate (improves serviceability)\n4. **Refinance** at new (higher) valuation — extract equity\n5. **Repeat** — use extracted equity as deposit for next property\n\n**Why it's powerful:** In theory, can cycle the same capital through multiple purchases. Each cycle leaves the investor with a tenanted property with minimal cash left in.\n\n**Risk:** Relies on valuations going up. Over-renovation, poor suburb selection, or rising interest rates can break the cycle.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Equity Stacking / Co-Investment (Emerging 2026 Trend)\n\n- Investors are layering junior and senior capital\n- Syndicating deals (multiple investors pooling into one purchase)\n- Partnering with funds to scale holdings without over-leveraging\n- Platform-based debt solutions filling gaps where banks won't lend\n\n**PropPath relevance:** Future feature — could PropPath model shared/syndicated portfolio scenarios?\n\n*Source: apimagazine.com.au*\n\n---\n\n## Key Strategic Insight for PropPath\n\n**The portfolio journey is a CYCLE, not a line:**\n\nBuy → Grow → Leverage → Buy → Grow → Leverage → [Manufacture if needed] → Buy...\n\nPropPath should visualise:\n1. The equity extraction moments (when can client buy again?)\n2. The \"manufacture equity\" opportunities (when does a reno make sense?)\n3. The structure decision points (when to move into trust/SMSF?)\n4. The consolidation phase (when to sell down and shift to commercial)\n\n**The alert feature Gameplans has (\"Sarah has enough equity for her next purchase\") is a CRITICAL PropPath feature.**\n"}}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openrouter","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6","usage":{"input":6967,"output":1482,"cacheRead":20321,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":28770,"cost":{"input":0.020901,"output":0.02223,"cacheRead":0.0060963,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.0492273}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771742343949}}

However:\n- Gameplans appears to be primarily a **session tool** (used live with the client)\n- PropPath is positioned as an **ongoing portfolio roadmap** (the client's living plan between sessions)\n- PropPath should offer what Gameplans doesn't: a client-facing portal, ongoing tracking, and the full journey visualisation (not just the next purchase)\n\n---\n\n## How BAs Structure Portfolio Planning Sessions\n\n### Standard Session Structure\n\n**Pre-session (client intake):**\n- Full financial picture: income, assets, liabilities, existing properties, borrowing capacity\n- Goals: number of properties target, passive income goal, timeline\n- Risk profile: conservative/balanced/aggressive\n\n**During session:**\n- Current position → Gap analysis (where are they now vs. where they want to be)\n- Borrowing capacity assessment (current and projected)\n- Portfolio strategy selection (growth-focused, yield-focused, hybrid)\n- Property roadmap: which property first, where, what type, when\n- Scenario modelling: \"what if\" comparisons\n- Equity projection: when can they buy property #2, #3, etc.\n\n**Session output (what clients receive):**\n- Property roadmap document (number of properties, timeline, rough targets)\n- Equity projections (how equity grows over time per property)\n- Cash flow projections (rental income vs. holding costs over time)\n- Borrowing capacity projections (year by year)\n- Strategy recommendation (buy-and-hold, BRRRR, rentvesting, etc.)\n\n### Purpose Property (Luke Wiles — Brisbane BA + Chartered Accountant)\n- **\"Portfolio Plan\" sessions** — one-off 1:1 strategy sessions\n- Sold as standalone product ($X per session) to people NOT wanting full BA services\n- Focus: creating a roadmap for the future\n- Client completes pre-session questionnaire first\n- Combines property strategy with tax/accounting view (unique given CA background)\n\n---\n\n## The Portfolio Roadmap — What It Actually Contains\n\nBased on research, a typical BA portfolio roadmap includes:\n\n| Element | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **Current position** | Existing assets, liabilities, equity, borrowing capacity |\n| **Target** | # properties, passive income goal, timeline (e.g. \"5 properties in 10 years\") |\n| **Property #1 plan** | Location, price range, type, expected yield, expected growth rate |\n| **Equity projection** | When is equity available for Property #2? |\n| **Property #2 plan** | Same as above, conditional on Property #1 performing |\n| **Cash flow summary** | Portfolio-level weekly/monthly cash flow at each stage |\n| **Borrowing capacity** | Year-by-year borrowing capacity as portfolio grows |\n| **Risk flags** | What breaks the plan (rate rises, vacancy, no growth) |\n| **Next action** | Immediate next step (often: \"go see mortgage broker\") |\n\n---\n\n## What Makes a Great Planning Session (BA Perspective)\n\nFrom Gameplans testimonials:\n- *\"Gives clients the ability to reverse engineer their end goal, then show them a path on how they're going to get there\"* — Jack Henderson\n- *\"Far more powerful and practical than spreadsheets, gives clients clarity and confidence\"* — Chris Gray\n- *\"So simple, yet handles complex scenarios\"* — Arjun Paliwal\n\n**Client psychology:** Clients don't want data. They want to SEE their future. Visual = confidence = purchase decision.\n\n---\n\n## PropPath Product Implications\n\n### What PropPath should do better than Gameplans:\n1. **Ongoing living roadmap** — not just a session tool. Client can log in anytime and see their roadmap.\n2. **Client-facing portal** — Gameplans appears BA-only. PropPath gives clients their own view.\n3. **Milestone tracking** — as properties are purchased, the plan updates in real-time.\n4. **Equity trigger alerts** — replicate Gameplans' \"Sarah has enough equity\" feature.\n5. **Simpler onboarding** — BA can set up a client plan in minutes, not hours.\n6. **BA → Client relationship tool** — keeps BA top of mind between purchases (not just at session time).\n\n### PropPath's Unique Position vs Gameplans:\n- Gameplans = **the session** (live, one-time, BA-facing)\n- PropPath = **the ongoing relationship** (persistent, client-facing, living plan)\n\nThese could be complementary — a BA uses Gameplans for the session, then hands client a PropPath link for ongoing tracking. OR PropPath replaces Gameplans entirely by doing both.\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions\n- What is Gameplans' pricing for BAs?\n- Does Gameplans have a client portal / ongoing access?\n- What does the actual Gameplans output look like (PDF? Interactive dashboard?)\n- How many BAs in Australia are currently using Gameplans?\n"}}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openrouter","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6","usage":{"input":4901,"output":1640,"cacheRead":23917,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":30458,"cost":{"input":0.014703,"output":0.0246,"cacheRead":0.007175099999999999,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.0464781}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771742383885}}
