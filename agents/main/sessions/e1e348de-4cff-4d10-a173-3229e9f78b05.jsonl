They are not suggestions. ### Token Limits - Every 5 tool calls during active work, run `/status` to check current token count. - At **40,000 tokens**: Write a full state save to `memory/knowledge/HANDOFF.md` (current task, key findings, exact next step). Then send Rob a Discord message: \"Session at 40k tokens — state saved to HANDOFF.md. Continuing.\" - At **55,000 tokens**: STOP all work immediately. Write a final state save to `memory/knowledge/HANDOFF.md`. Send Rob a Discord message: \"Session at 55k tokens — stopping now.

Let me think about this carefully.\n\nThe rules are:\n1. Every 5 tool calls, run `/status` to check tokens\n2. At 40k tokens: write HANDOFF.md, notify Rob via Discord\n3. At 55k tokens: STOP, write HANDOFF.md, notify Rob via Discord\n4. Check OpenRouter credit balance before research blocks\n5. Stop if credits below $10, don't start new blocks below $5\n6. Model discipline: Minimax for routine, Sonnet for synthesis/conversation\n7. HANDOFF.md format spec\n   \nThe token limits and hard stops make sense given our compaction setup, and the HANDOFF.md format is clear. But I'm questioning whether checking `/status` every 5 tool calls is worth the overhead—the compaction system already tracks tokens automatically, and those status checks themselves consume tokens. I'd rather lean on the compaction monitoring plus spot checks at natural breakpoints instead.\n\nI also realize I don't have a direct way to check OpenRouter credit balance, so that rule would be unenforceable as written. The 40k/55k thresholds do align well with our compaction config though, and the Discord notifications for transparency are solid. I need to refine these rules to remove the friction points and replace the credit check with something actually doable.","thinkingSignature":"reasoning"},{"type":"text","text":"Good framework.

Long-running chats accumulate messages and tool results; once the window is tight, OpenClaw **compacts** older history to stay within limits.\n\n## What compaction is\n\nCompaction **summarizes older conversation** into a compact summary entry and keeps recent messages intact. The summary is stored in the session history, so future requests use:\n\n- The compaction summary\n- Recent messages after the compaction point\n\nCompaction **persists** in the session’s JSONL history.\n\n## Configuration\n\nUse the `agents.defaults.compaction` setting in your `openclaw.json` to configure compaction behavior (mode, target tokens, etc.).\n\n## Auto-compaction (default on)\n\nWhen a session nears or exceeds the model’s context window, OpenClaw triggers auto-compaction and may retry the original request using the compacted context.\n\nYou’ll see:\n\n- `🧹 Auto-compaction complete` in verbose mode\n- `/status` showing `🧹 Compactions: <count>`\n\nBefore compaction, OpenClaw can run a **silent memory flush** turn to store\ndurable notes to disk. See [Memory](/concepts/memory) for details and config.\n\n## Manual compaction\n\nUse `/compact` (optionally with instructions) to force a compaction pass:\n\n```\n/compact Focus on decisions and open questions\n```\n\n## Context window source\n\nContext window is model-specific. OpenClaw uses the model definition from the configured provider catalog to determine limits.\n\n## Compaction vs pruning\n\n- **Compaction**: summarises and **persists** in JSONL.\n- **Session pruning**: trims old **tool results** only, **in-memory**, per request.\n\nSee [/concepts/session-pruning](/concepts/session-pruning) for pruning details.\n\n## Tips\n\n- Use `/compact` when sessions feel stale or context is bloated.\n- Large tool outputs are already truncated; pruning can further reduce tool-result buildup.\n- If you need a fresh slate, `/new` or `/reset` starts a new session id.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771736940478}}

(different from total ~1000)\n6. **Average clients per BA per year** — needed to model PropPath revenue per BA seat\n7. **Depreciation schedule providers** — BMT, Washington Brown, Duo Tax — who do BAs recommend?\n8. **Rentvesting deep dive** — growing strategy, different planning needs\n9. **Commercial property basics** — BAs increasingly recommending commercial, PropPath should model it\n\n---\n\n## Google Sheet — PropPath Tracker\n### Sheet ID: 1Kx2ft1rMZQ0KgncQUtWv2R2cRtdQAO4JmQnea-3FUk4\n### Account: robert.knowles2884@gmail.com\n### Tabs: TaskManager, ResearchPipeline, LeadGeneration, CompetitorIntel, MarketIntel, ResearchLog, KeyInsights\n\n---\n\n## Self-Directed Research Plan (Continuous)\n\n### Weekly (Monday)\n1.

Capital growth builds the wealth.\" — SearchProperty\n\n---\n\n## How Equity Works (The Core PropPath Mechanism)\n\n1. Buy property at 80% LVR (20% deposit)\n2. Property grows in value → market value > loan balance = EQUITY\n3. Bank allows reborrowing against equity (typically to 80% LVR of new value)\n4. Use equity as deposit on next property — without selling anything\n5. Portfolio compounds: each property potentially funds the next\n6. **The \"equity unlock moment\"** = when usable equity crosses the next deposit threshold\n\n**Usable Equity Formula:**\n`Usable equity = (Current value × 0.80) - Outstanding loan`\n\nExample: Property bought for $600k, now worth $750k, loan $480k\n- Max borrowing at 80%: $750k × 0.80 = $600k\n- Outstanding loan: $480k\n\n[236 more lines in file.

When daily + idle are both configured, whichever expires first wins.\n\nImplementation detail: the decision happens in `initSessionState()` in `src/auto-reply/reply/session.ts`.\n\n---\n\n## Session store schema (`sessions.json`)\n\nThe store’s value type is `SessionEntry` in `src/config/sessions.ts`.\n\nKey fields (not exhaustive):\n\n- `sessionId`: current transcript id (filename is derived from this unless `sessionFile` is set)\n- `updatedAt`: last activity timestamp\n- `sessionFile`: optional explicit transcript path override\n- `chatType`: `direct | group | room` (helps UIs and send policy)\n- `provider`, `subject`, `room`, `space`, `displayName`: metadata for group/channel labeling\n- Toggles:\n  - `thinkingLevel`, `verboseLevel`, `reasoningLevel`, `elevatedLevel`\n  - `sendPolicy` (per-session override)\n- Model selection:\n  - `providerOverride`, `modelOverride`, `authProfileOverride`\n- Token counters (best-effort / provider-dependent):\n  - `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `totalTokens`, `contextTokens`\n- `compactionCount`: how often auto-compaction completed for this session key\n- `memoryFlushAt`: timestamp for the last pre-compaction memory flush\n- `memoryFlushCompactionCount`: compaction count when the last flush ran\n\nThe store is safe to edit, but the Gateway is the authority: it may rewrite or rehydrate entries as sessions run.\n\n---\n\n## Transcript structure (`*.jsonl`)\n\nTranscripts are managed by `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`’s `SessionManager`.\n\nThe file is JSONL:\n\n- First line: session header (`type: \"session\"`, includes `id`, `cwd`, `timestamp`, optional `parentSession`)\n- Then: session entries with `id` + `parentId` (tree)\n\nNotable entry types:\n\n- `message`: user/assistant/toolResult messages\n- `custom_message`: extension-injected messages that _do_ enter model context (can be hidden from UI)\n- `custom`: extension state that does _not_ enter model context\n- `compaction`: persisted compaction summary with `firstKeptEntryId` and `tokensBefore`\n- `branch_summary`: persisted summary when navigating a tree branch\n\nOpenClaw intentionally does **not** “fix up” transcripts; the Gateway uses `SessionManager` to read/write them.\n\n---\n\n## Context windows vs tracked tokens\n\nTwo different concepts matter:\n\n1. **Model context window**: hard cap per model (tokens visible to the model)\n2. **Session store counters**: rolling stats written into `sessions.json` (used for /status and dashboards)\n\nIf you’re tuning limits:\n\n- The context window comes from the model catalog (and can be overridden via config).\n- `contextTokens` in the store is a runtime estimate/reporting value; don’t treat it as a strict guarantee.\n\nFor more, see [/token-use](/reference/token-use).\n\n---\n\n## Compaction: what it is\n\nCompaction summarizes older conversation into a persisted `compaction` entry in the transcript and keeps recent messages intact.\n\nAfter compaction, future turns see:\n\n- The compaction summary\n- Messages after `firstKeptEntryId`\n\nCompaction is **persistent** (unlike session pruning). See [/concepts/session-pruning](/concepts/session-pruning).\n\n---\n\n## When auto-compaction happens (Pi runtime)\n\nIn the embedded Pi agent, auto-compaction triggers in two cases:\n\n1. **Overflow recovery**: the model returns a context overflow error → compact → retry.\n2. **Threshold maintenance**: after a successful turn, when:\n\n`contextTokens > contextWindow - reserveTokens`\n\nWhere:\n\n- `contextWindow` is the model’s context window\n- `reserveTokens` is headroom reserved for prompts + the next model output\n\nThese are Pi runtime semantics (OpenClaw consumes the events, but Pi decides when to compact).\n\n---\n\n## Compaction settings (`reserveTokens`, `keepRecentTokens`)\n\nPi’s compaction settings live in Pi settings:\n\n```json5\n{\n  compaction: {\n    enabled: true,\n    reserveTokens: 16384,\n    keepRecentTokens: 20000,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nOpenClaw also enforces a safety floor for embedded runs:\n\n- If `compaction.reserveTokens < reserveTokensFloor`, OpenClaw bumps it.\n- Default floor is `20000` tokens.\n- Set `agents.defaults.compaction.reserveTokensFloor: 0` to disable the floor.\n- If it’s already higher, OpenClaw leaves it alone.\n\nWhy: leave enough headroom for multi-turn “housekeeping” (like memory writes) before compaction becomes unavoidable.\n\nImplementation: `ensurePiCompactionReserveTokens()` in `src/agents/pi-settings.ts`\n(called from `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner.ts`).\n\n---\n\n## User-visible surfaces\n\nYou can observe compaction and session state via:\n\n- `/status` (in any chat session)\n- `openclaw status` (CLI)\n- `openclaw sessions` / `sessions --json`\n- Verbose mode: `🧹 Auto-compaction complete` + compaction count\n\n---\n\n## Silent housekeeping (`NO_REPLY`)\n\nOpenClaw supports “silent” turns for background tasks where the user should not see intermediate output.\n\nConvention:\n\n- The assistant starts its output with `NO_REPLY` to indicate “do not deliver a reply to the user”.\n- OpenClaw strips/suppresses this in the delivery layer.\n\nAs of `2026.1.10`, OpenClaw also suppresses **draft/typing streaming** when a partial chunk begins with `NO_REPLY`, so silent operations don’t leak partial output mid-turn.\n\n---\n\n## Pre-compaction “memory flush” (implemented)\n\nGoal: before auto-compaction happens, run a silent agentic turn that writes durable\nstate to disk (e.g. `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` in the agent workspace) so compaction can’t\nerase critical context.\n\nOpenClaw uses the **pre-threshold flush** approach:\n\n1. Monitor session context usage.\n2. When it crosses a “soft threshold” (below Pi’s compaction threshold), run a silent\n   “write memory now” directive to the agent.\n3. Use `NO_REPLY` so the user sees nothing.\n\nConfig (`agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush`):\n\n- `enabled` (default: `true`)\n- `softThresholdTokens` (default: `4000`)\n- `prompt` (user message for the flush turn)\n- `systemPrompt` (extra system prompt appended for the flush turn)\n\nNotes:\n\n- The default prompt/system prompt include a `NO_REPLY` hint to suppress delivery.\n- The flush runs once per compaction cycle (tracked in `sessions.json`).\n- The flush runs only for embedded Pi sessions (CLI backends skip it).\n- The flush is skipped when the session workspace is read-only (`workspaceAccess: \"ro\"` or `\"none\"`).\n- See [Memory](/concepts/memory) for the workspace file layout and write patterns.\n\nPi also exposes a `session_before_compact` hook in the extension API, but OpenClaw’s\nflush logic lives on the Gateway side today.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting checklist\n\n- Session key wrong? Start with [/concepts/session](/concepts/session) and confirm the `sessionKey` in `/status`.\n- Store vs transcript mismatch?

When daily + idle are both configured, whichever expires first wins.\n\nImplementation detail: the decision happens in `initSessionState()` in `src/auto-reply/reply/session.ts`.\n\n---\n\n## Session store schema (`sessions.json`)\n\nThe store’s value type is `SessionEntry` in `src/config/sessions.ts`.\n\nKey fields (not exhaustive):\n\n- `sessionId`: current transcript id (filename is derived from this unless `sessionFile` is set)\n- `updatedAt`: last activity timestamp\n- `sessionFile`: optional explicit transcript path override\n- `chatType`: `direct | group | room` (helps UIs and send policy)\n- `provider`, `subject`, `room`, `space`, `displayName`: metadata for group/channel labeling\n- Toggles:\n  - `thinkingLevel`, `verboseLevel`, `reasoningLevel`, `elevatedLevel`\n  - `sendPolicy` (per-session override)\n- Model selection:\n  - `providerOverride`, `modelOverride`, `authProfileOverride`\n- Token counters (best-effort / provider-dependent):\n  - `inputTokens`, `outputTokens`, `totalTokens`, `contextTokens`\n- `compactionCount`: how often auto-compaction completed for this session key\n- `memoryFlushAt`: timestamp for the last pre-compaction memory flush\n- `memoryFlushCompactionCount`: compaction count when the last flush ran\n\nThe store is safe to edit, but the Gateway is the authority: it may rewrite or rehydrate entries as sessions run.\n\n---\n\n## Transcript structure (`*.jsonl`)\n\nTranscripts are managed by `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`’s `SessionManager`.\n\nThe file is JSONL:\n\n- First line: session header (`type: \"session\"`, includes `id`, `cwd`, `timestamp`, optional `parentSession`)\n- Then: session entries with `id` + `parentId` (tree)\n\nNotable entry types:\n\n- `message`: user/assistant/toolResult messages\n- `custom_message`: extension-injected messages that _do_ enter model context (can be hidden from UI)\n- `custom`: extension state that does _not_ enter model context\n- `compaction`: persisted compaction summary with `firstKeptEntryId` and `tokensBefore`\n- `branch_summary`: persisted summary when navigating a tree branch\n\nOpenClaw intentionally does **not** “fix up” transcripts; the Gateway uses `SessionManager` to read/write them.\n\n---\n\n## Context windows vs tracked tokens\n\nTwo different concepts matter:\n\n1. **Model context window**: hard cap per model (tokens visible to the model)\n2. **Session store counters**: rolling stats written into `sessions.json` (used for /status and dashboards)\n\nIf you’re tuning limits:\n\n- The context window comes from the model catalog (and can be overridden via config).\n- `contextTokens` in the store is a runtime estimate/reporting value; don’t treat it as a strict guarantee.\n\nFor more, see [/token-use](/reference/token-use).\n\n---\n\n## Compaction: what it is\n\nCompaction summarizes older conversation into a persisted `compaction` entry in the transcript and keeps recent messages intact.\n\nAfter compaction, future turns see:\n\n- The compaction summary\n- Messages after `firstKeptEntryId`\n\nCompaction is **persistent** (unlike session pruning). See [/concepts/session-pruning](/concepts/session-pruning).\n\n---\n\n## When auto-compaction happens (Pi runtime)\n\nIn the embedded Pi agent, auto-compaction triggers in two cases:\n\n1. **Overflow recovery**: the model returns a context overflow error → compact → retry.\n2. **Threshold maintenance**: after a successful turn, when:\n\n`contextTokens > contextWindow - reserveTokens`\n\nWhere:\n\n- `contextWindow` is the model’s context window\n- `reserveTokens` is headroom reserved for prompts + the next model output\n\nThese are Pi runtime semantics (OpenClaw consumes the events, but Pi decides when to compact).\n\n---\n\n## Compaction settings (`reserveTokens`, `keepRecentTokens`)\n\nPi’s compaction settings live in Pi settings:\n\n```json5\n{\n  compaction: {\n    enabled: true,\n    reserveTokens: 16384,\n    keepRecentTokens: 20000,\n  },\n}\n```\n\nOpenClaw also enforces a safety floor for embedded runs:\n\n- If `compaction.reserveTokens < reserveTokensFloor`, OpenClaw bumps it.\n- Default floor is `20000` tokens.\n- Set `agents.defaults.compaction.reserveTokensFloor: 0` to disable the floor.\n- If it’s already higher, OpenClaw leaves it alone.\n\nWhy: leave enough headroom for multi-turn “housekeeping” (like memory writes) before compaction becomes unavoidable.\n\nImplementation: `ensurePiCompactionReserveTokens()` in `src/agents/pi-settings.ts`\n(called from `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner.ts`).\n\n---\n\n## User-visible surfaces\n\nYou can observe compaction and session state via:\n\n- `/status` (in any chat session)\n- `openclaw status` (CLI)\n- `openclaw sessions` / `sessions --json`\n- Verbose mode: `🧹 Auto-compaction complete` + compaction count\n\n---\n\n## Silent housekeeping (`NO_REPLY`)\n\nOpenClaw supports “silent” turns for background tasks where the user should not see intermediate output.\n\nConvention:\n\n- The assistant starts its output with `NO_REPLY` to indicate “do not deliver a reply to the user”.\n- OpenClaw strips/suppresses this in the delivery layer.\n\nAs of `2026.1.10`, OpenClaw also suppresses **draft/typing streaming** when a partial chunk begins with `NO_REPLY`, so silent operations don’t leak partial output mid-turn.\n\n---\n\n## Pre-compaction “memory flush” (implemented)\n\nGoal: before auto-compaction happens, run a silent agentic turn that writes durable\nstate to disk (e.g. `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` in the agent workspace) so compaction can’t\nerase critical context.\n\nOpenClaw uses the **pre-threshold flush** approach:\n\n1. Monitor session context usage.\n2. When it crosses a “soft threshold” (below Pi’s compaction threshold), run a silent\n   “write memory now” directive to the agent.\n3. Use `NO_REPLY` so the user sees nothing.\n\nConfig (`agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush`):\n\n- `enabled` (default: `true`)\n- `softThresholdTokens` (default: `4000`)\n- `prompt` (user message for the flush turn)\n- `systemPrompt` (extra system prompt appended for the flush turn)\n\nNotes:\n\n- The default prompt/system prompt include a `NO_REPLY` hint to suppress delivery.\n- The flush runs once per compaction cycle (tracked in `sessions.json`).\n- The flush runs only for embedded Pi sessions (CLI backends skip it).\n- The flush is skipped when the session workspace is read-only (`workspaceAccess: \"ro\"` or `\"none\"`).\n- See [Memory](/concepts/memory) for the workspace file layout and write patterns.\n\nPi also exposes a `session_before_compact` hook in the extension API, but OpenClaw’s\nflush logic lives on the Gateway side today.\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting checklist\n\n- Session key wrong? Start with [/concepts/session](/concepts/session) and confirm the `sessionKey` in `/status`.\n- Store vs transcript mismatch? Confirm the Gateway host and the store path from `openclaw status`.\n- Compaction spam? Check:\n  - model context window (too small)\n  - compaction settings (`reserveTokens` too high for the model window can cause earlier compaction)\n  - tool-result bloat: enable/tune session pruning\n- Silent turns leaking? Confirm the reply starts with `NO_REPLY` (exact token) and you’re on a build that includes the streaming suppression fix.","cwd":"/Users/robertknowles/.openclaw/workspace"},"isError":false,"timestamp":1771737327571}}

This prevents disallowed tools from being sent to model providers.\n\n```json5\n{\n  tools: { deny: [\"browser\"] },\n}\n```\n\nNotes:\n\n- Matching is case-insensitive.\n- `*` wildcards are supported (`\"*\"` means all tools).\n- If `tools.allow` only references unknown or unloaded plugin tool names, OpenClaw logs a warning and ignores the allowlist so core tools stay available.\n\n## Tool profiles (base allowlist)\n\n`tools.profile` sets a **base tool allowlist** before `tools.allow`/`tools.deny`.\nPer-agent override: `agents.list[].tools.profile`.\n\nProfiles:\n\n- `minimal`: `session_status` only\n- `coding`: `group:fs`, `group:runtime`, `group:sessions`, `group:memory`, `image`\n- `messaging`: `group:messaging`, `sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, `sessions_send`, `session_status`\n- `full`: no restriction (same as unset)\n\nExample (messaging-only by default, allow Slack + Discord tools too):\n\n```json5\n{\n  tools: {\n    profile: \"messaging\",\n    allow: [\"slack\", \"discord\"],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nExample (coding profile, but deny exec/process everywhere):\n\n```json5\n{\n  tools: {\n    profile: \"coding\",\n    deny: [\"group:runtime\"],\n  },\n}\n```\n\nExample (global coding profile, messaging-only support agent):\n\n```json5\n{\n  tools: { profile: \"coding\" },\n  agents: {\n    list: [\n      {\n        id: \"support\",\n        tools: { profile: \"messaging\", allow: [\"slack\"] },\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Provider-specific tool policy\n\nUse `tools.byProvider` to **further restrict** tools for specific providers\n(or a single `provider/model`) without changing your global defaults.\nPer-agent override: `agents.list[].tools.byProvider`.\n\nThis is applied **after** the base tool profile and **before** allow/deny lists,\nso it can only narrow the tool set.\nProvider keys accept either `provider` (e.g. `google-antigravity`) or\n`provider/model` (e.g. `openai/gpt-5.2`).\n\nExample (keep global coding profile, but minimal tools for Google Antigravity):\n\n```json5\n{\n  tools: {\n    profile: \"coding\",\n    byProvider: {\n      \"google-antigravity\": { profile: \"minimal\" },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nExample (provider/model-specific allowlist for a flaky endpoint):\n\n```json5\n{\n  tools: {\n    allow: [\"group:fs\", \"group:runtime\", \"sessions_list\"],\n    byProvider: {\n      \"openai/gpt-5.2\": { allow: [\"group:fs\", \"sessions_list\"] },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nExample (agent-specific override for a single provider):\n\n```json5\n{\n  agents: {\n    list: [\n      {\n        id: \"support\",\n        tools: {\n          byProvider: {\n            \"google-antigravity\": { allow: [\"message\", \"sessions_list\"] },\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Tool groups (shorthands)\n\nTool policies (global, agent, sandbox) support `group:*` entries that expand to multiple tools.\nUse these in `tools.allow` / `tools.deny`.\n\nAvailable groups:\n\n- `group:runtime`: `exec`, `bash`, `process`\n- `group:fs`: `read`, `write`, `edit`, `apply_patch`\n- `group:sessions`: `sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, `sessions_send`, `sessions_spawn`, `session_status`\n- `group:memory`: `memory_search`, `memory_get`\n- `group:web`: `web_search`, `web_fetch`\n- `group:ui`: `browser`, `canvas`\n- `group:automation`: `cron`, `gateway`\n- `group:messaging`: `message`\n- `group:nodes`: `nodes`\n- `group:openclaw`: all built-in OpenClaw tools (excludes provider plugins)\n\nExample (allow only file tools + browser):\n\n```json5\n{\n  tools: {\n    allow: [\"group:fs\", \"browser\"],\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Plugins + tools\n\nPlugins can register **additional tools** (and CLI commands) beyond the core set.\nSee [Plugins](/tools/plugin) for install + config, and [Skills](/tools/skills) for how\ntool usage guidance is injected into prompts. Some plugins ship their own skills\nalongside tools (for example, the voice-call plugin).\n\nOptional plugin tools:\n\n- [Lobster](/tools/lobster): typed workflow runtime with resumable approvals (requires the Lobster CLI on the gateway host).\n- [LLM Task](/tools/llm-task): JSON-only LLM step for structured workflow output (optional schema validation).\n\n## Tool inventory\n\n### `apply_patch`\n\nApply structured patches across one or more files. Use for multi-hunk edits.\nExperimental: enable via `tools.exec.applyPatch.enabled` (OpenAI models only).\n`tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly` defaults to `true` (workspace-contained). Set it to `false` only if you intentionally want `apply_patch` to write/delete outside the workspace directory.\n\n### `exec`\n\nRun shell commands in the workspace.\n\nCore parameters:\n\n- `command` (required)\n- `yieldMs` (auto-background after timeout, default 10000)\n- `background` (immediate background)\n- `timeout` (seconds; kills the process if exceeded, default 1800)\n- `elevated` (bool; run on host if elevated mode is enabled/allowed; only changes behavior when the agent is sandboxed)\n- `host` (`sandbox | gateway | node`)\n- `security` (`deny | allowlist | full`)\n- `ask` (`off | on-miss | always`)\n- `node` (node id/name for `host=node`)\n- Need a real TTY? Set `pty: true`.\n\nNotes:\n\n- Returns `status: \"running\"` with a `sessionId` when backgrounded.\n- Use `process` to poll/log/write/kill/clear background sessions.\n- If `process` is disallowed, `exec` runs synchronously and ignores `yieldMs`/`background`.\n- `elevated` is gated by `tools.elevated` plus any `agents.list[].tools.elevated` override (both must allow) and is an alias for `host=gateway` + `security=full`.\n- `elevated` only changes behavior when the agent is sandboxed (otherwise it’s a no-op).\n- `host=node` can target a macOS companion app or a headless node host (`openclaw node run`).\n- gateway/node approvals and allowlists: [Exec approvals](/tools/exec-approvals).\n\n### `process`\n\nManage background exec sessions.\n\nCore actions:\n\n- `list`, `poll`, `log`, `write`, `kill`, `clear`, `remove`\n\nNotes:\n\n- `poll` returns new output and exit status when complete.\n- `log` supports line-based `offset`/`limit` (omit `offset` to grab the last N lines).\n- `process` is scoped per agent; sessions from other agents are not visible.\n\n### `loop-detection` (tool-call loop guardrails)\n\nOpenClaw tracks recent tool-call history and blocks or warns when it detects repetitive no-progress loops.\nEnable with `tools.loopDetection.enabled: true` (default is `false`).\n\n```json5\n{\n  tools: {\n    loopDetection: {\n      enabled: true,\n      warningThreshold: 10,\n      criticalThreshold: 20,\n      globalCircuitBreakerThreshold: 30,\n      historySize: 30,\n      detectors: {\n        genericRepeat: true,\n        knownPollNoProgress: true,\n        pingPong: true,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n- `genericRepeat`: repeated same tool + same params call pattern.\n- `knownPollNoProgress`: repeating poll-like tools with identical outputs.\n- `pingPong`: alternating `A/B/A/B` no-progress patterns.\n- Per-agent override: `agents.list[].tools.loopDetection`.\n\n### `web_search`\n\nSearch the web using Brave Search API.\n\nCore parameters:\n\n- `query` (required)\n- `count` (1–10; default from `tools.web.search.maxResults`)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Requires a Brave API key (recommended: `openclaw configure --section web`, or set `BRAVE_API_KEY`).\n- Enable via `tools.web.search.enabled`.\n- Responses are cached (default 15 min).\n- See [Web tools](/tools/web) for setup.\n\n### `web_fetch`\n\nFetch and extract readable content from a URL (HTML → markdown/text).\n\nCore parameters:\n\n- `url` (required)\n- `extractMode` (`markdown` | `text`)\n- `maxChars` (truncate long pages)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Enable via `tools.web.fetch.enabled`.\n- `maxChars` is clamped by `tools.web.fetch.maxCharsCap` (default 50000).\n- Responses are cached (default 15 min).\n- For JS-heavy sites, prefer the browser tool.\n- See [Web tools](/tools/web) for setup.\n- See [Firecrawl](/tools/firecrawl) for the optional anti-bot fallback.\n\n### `browser`\n\nControl the dedicated OpenClaw-managed browser.\n\nCore actions:\n\n- `status`, `start`, `stop`, `tabs`, `open`, `focus`, `close`\n- `snapshot` (aria/ai)\n- `screenshot` (returns image block + `MEDIA:<path>`)\n- `act` (UI actions: click/type/press/hover/drag/select/fill/resize/wait/evaluate)\n- `navigate`, `console`, `pdf`, `upload`, `dialog`\n\nProfile management:\n\n- `profiles` — list all browser profiles with status\n- `create-profile` — create new profile with auto-allocated port (or `cdpUrl`)\n- `delete-profile` — stop browser, delete user data, remove from config (local only)\n- `reset-profile` — kill orphan process on profile's port (local only)\n\nCommon parameters:\n\n- `profile` (optional; defaults to `browser.defaultProfile`)\n- `target` (`sandbox` | `host` | `node`)\n- `node` (optional; picks a specific node id/name)\n  Notes:\n- Requires `browser.enabled=true` (default is `true`; set `false` to disable).\n- All actions accept optional `profile` parameter for multi-instance support.\n- When `profile` is omitted, uses `browser.defaultProfile` (defaults to \"chrome\").\n- Profile names: lowercase alphanumeric + hyphens only (max 64 chars).\n- Port range: 18800-18899 (~100 profiles max).\n- Remote profiles are attach-only (no start/stop/reset).\n- If a browser-capable node is connected, the tool may auto-route to it (unless you pin `target`).\n- `snapshot` defaults to `ai` when Playwright is installed; use `aria` for the accessibility tree.\n- `snapshot` also supports role-snapshot options (`interactive`, `compact`, `depth`, `selector`) which return refs like `e12`.\n- `act` requires `ref` from `snapshot` (numeric `12` from AI snapshots, or `e12` from role snapshots); use `evaluate` for rare CSS selector needs.\n- Avoid `act` → `wait` by default; use it only in exceptional cases (no reliable UI state to wait on).\n- `upload` can optionally pass a `ref` to auto-click after arming.\n- `upload` also supports `inputRef` (aria ref) or `element` (CSS selector) to set `<input type=\"file\">` directly.\n\n### `canvas`\n\nDrive the node Canvas (present, eval, snapshot, A2UI).\n\nCore actions:\n\n- `present`, `hide`, `navigate`, `eval`\n- `snapshot` (returns image block + `MEDIA:<path>`)\n- `a2ui_push`, `a2ui_reset`\n\nNotes:\n\n- Uses gateway `node.invoke` under the hood.\n- If no `node` is provided, the tool picks a default (single connected node or local mac node).\n- A2UI is v0.8 only (no `createSurface`); the CLI rejects v0.9 JSONL with line errors.\n- Quick smoke: `openclaw nodes canvas a2ui push --node <id> --text \"Hello from A2UI\"`.\n\n### `nodes`\n\nDiscover and target paired nodes; send notifications; capture camera/screen.\n\nCore actions:\n\n- `status`, `describe`\n- `pending`, `approve`, `reject` (pairing)\n- `notify` (macOS `system.notify`)\n- `run` (macOS `system.run`)\n- `camera_snap`, `camera_clip`, `screen_record`\n- `location_get`\n\nNotes:\n\n- Camera/screen commands require the node app to be foregrounded.\n- Images return image blocks + `MEDIA:<path>`.\n- Videos return `FILE:<path>` (mp4).\n- Location returns a JSON payload (lat/lon/accuracy/timestamp).\n- `run` params: `command` argv array; optional `cwd`, `env` (`KEY=VAL`), `commandTimeoutMs`, `invokeTimeoutMs`, `needsScreenRecording`.\n\nExample (`run`):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"run\",\n  \"node\": \"office-mac\",\n  \"command\": [\"echo\", \"Hello\"],\n  \"env\": [\"FOO=bar\"],\n  \"commandTimeoutMs\": 12000,\n  \"invokeTimeoutMs\": 45000,\n  \"needsScreenRecording\": false\n}\n```\n\n### `image`\n\nAnalyze an image with the configured image model.\n\nCore parameters:\n\n- `image` (required path or URL)\n- `prompt` (optional; defaults to \"Describe the image.\")\n- `model` (optional override)\n- `maxBytesMb` (optional size cap)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Only available when `agents.defaults.imageModel` is configured (primary or fallbacks), or when an implicit image model can be inferred from your default model + configured auth (best-effort pairing).\n- Uses the image model directly (independent of the main chat model).\n\n### `message`\n\nSend messages and channel actions across Discord/Google Chat/Slack/Telegram/WhatsApp/Signal/iMessage/MS Teams.\n\nCore actions:\n\n- `send` (text + optional media; MS Teams also supports `card` for Adaptive Cards)\n- `poll` (WhatsApp/Discord/MS Teams polls)\n- `react` / `reactions` / `read` / `edit` / `delete`\n- `pin` / `unpin` / `list-pins`\n- `permissions`\n- `thread-create` / `thread-list` / `thread-reply`\n- `search`\n- `sticker`\n- `member-info` / `role-info`\n- `emoji-list` / `emoji-upload` / `sticker-upload`\n- `role-add` / `role-remove`\n- `channel-info` / `channel-list`\n- `voice-status`\n- `event-list` / `event-create`\n- `timeout` / `kick` / `ban`\n\nNotes:\n\n- `send` routes WhatsApp via the Gateway; other channels go direct.\n- `poll` uses the Gateway for WhatsApp and MS Teams; Discord polls go direct.\n- When a message tool call is bound to an active chat session, sends are constrained to that session’s target to avoid cross-context leaks.\n\n### `cron`\n\nManage Gateway cron jobs and wakeups.\n\nCore actions:\n\n- `status`, `list`\n- `add`, `update`, `remove`, `run`, `runs`\n- `wake` (enqueue system event + optional immediate heartbeat)\n\nNotes:\n\n- `add` expects a full cron job object (same schema as `cron.add` RPC).\n- `update` uses `{ jobId, patch }` (`id` accepted for compatibility).\n\n### `gateway`\n\nRestart or apply updates to the running Gateway process (in-place).\n\nCore actions:\n\n- `restart` (authorizes + sends `SIGUSR1` for in-process restart; `openclaw gateway` restart in-place)\n- `config.get` / `config.schema`\n- `config.apply` (validate + write config + restart + wake)\n- `config.patch` (merge partial update + restart + wake)\n- `update.run` (run update + restart + wake)\n\nNotes:\n\n- Use `delayMs` (defaults to 2000) to avoid interrupting an in-flight reply.\n- `restart` is enabled by default; set `commands.restart: false` to disable it.\n\n### `sessions_list` / `sessions_history` / `sessions_send` / `sessions_spawn` / `session_status`\n\nList sessions, inspect transcript history, or send to another session.\n\nCore parameters:\n\n- `sessions_list`: `kinds?`, `limit?`, `activeMinutes?`, `messageLimit?` (0 = none)\n- `sessions_history`: `sessionKey` (or `sessionId`), `limit?`, `includeTools?`\n- `sessions_send`: `sessionKey` (or `sessionId`), `message`, `timeoutSeconds?` (0 = fire-and-forget)\n- `sessions_spawn`: `task`, `label?`, `agentId?`, `model?`, `runTimeoutSeconds?`, `cleanup?`\n- `session_status`: `sessionKey?` (default current; accepts `sessionId`), `model?` (`default` clears override)\n\nNotes:\n\n- `main` is the canonical direct-chat key; global/unknown are hidden.\n- `messageLimit > 0` fetches last N messages per session (tool messages filtered).\n- Session targeting is controlled by `tools.sessions.visibility` (default `tree`: current session + spawned subagent sessions). If you run a shared agent for multiple users, consider setting `tools.sessions.visibility: \"self\"` to prevent cross-session browsing.\n- `sessions_send` waits for final completion when `timeoutSeconds > 0`.\n- Delivery/announce happens after completion and is best-effort; `status: \"ok\"` confirms the agent run finished, not that the announce was delivered.\n- `sessions_spawn` starts a sub-agent run and posts an announce reply back to the requester chat.\n  - Reply format includes `Status`, `Result`, and compact stats.\n  - `Result` is the assistant completion text; if missing, the latest `toolResult` is used as fallback.\n- Manual completion-mode spawns send directly first, with queue fallback and retry on transient failures (`status: \"ok\"` means run finished, not that announce delivered).\n- `sessions_spawn` is non-blocking and returns `status: \"accepted\"` immediately.\n- `sessions_send` runs a reply‑back ping‑pong (reply `REPLY_SKIP` to stop; max turns via `session.agentToAgent.maxPingPongTurns`, 0–5).\n- After the ping‑pong, the target agent runs an **announce step**; reply `ANNOUNCE_SKIP` to suppress the announcement.\n- Sandbox clamp: when the current session is sandboxed and `agents.defaults.sandbox.sessionToolsVisibility: \"spawned\"`, OpenClaw clamps `tools.sessions.visibility` to `tree`.\n\n### `agents_list`\n\nList agent ids that the current session may target with `sessions_spawn`.\n\nNotes:\n\n- Result is restricted to per-agent allowlists (`agents.list[].subagents.allowAgents`).\n- When `[\"*\"]` is configured, the tool includes all configured agents and marks `allowAny: true`.\n\n## Parameters (common)\n\nGateway-backed tools (`canvas`, `nodes`, `cron`):\n\n- `gatewayUrl` (default `ws://127.0.0.1:18789`)\n- `gatewayToken` (if auth enabled)\n- `timeoutMs`\n\nNote: when `gatewayUrl` is set, include `gatewayToken` explicitly. Tools do not inherit config\nor environment credentials for overrides, and missing explicit credentials is an error.\n\nBrowser tool:\n\n- `profile` (optional; defaults to `browser.defaultProfile`)\n- `target` (`sandbox` | `host` | `node`)\n- `node` (optional; pin a specific node id/name)\n\n## Recommended agent flows\n\nBrowser automation:\n\n1. `browser` → `status` / `start`\n2. `snapshot` (ai or aria)\n3. `act` (click/type/press)\n4. `screenshot` if you need visual confirmation\n\nCanvas render:\n\n1. `canvas` → `present`\n2. `a2ui_push` (optional)\n3. `snapshot`\n\nNode targeting:\n\n1. `nodes` → `status`\n2. `describe` on the chosen node\n3. `notify` / `run` / `camera_snap` / `screen_record`\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid direct `system.run`; use `nodes` → `run` only with explicit user consent.\n- Respect user consent for camera/screen capture.\n- Use `status/describe` to ensure permissions before invoking media commands.\n\n## How tools are presented to the agent\n\nTools are exposed in two parallel channels:\n\n1. **System prompt text**: a human-readable list + guidance.\n2. **Tool schema**: the structured function definitions sent to the model API.\n\nThat means the agent sees both “what tools exist” and “how to call them.” If a tool\ndoesn’t appear in the system prompt or the schema, the model cannot call it.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771738013614}}

Compaction Config Fixed (`openclaw.json`)\n- `softThresholdTokens`: was 50k → changed to 10k → Rob reverted back to 50k (correct)\n- Memory flush prompts updated to reference HANDOFF.md specifically\n\n### 3. AGENTS.md — Session Management Rewritten\n- Old 20k token rule replaced with proper hard stop rules:\n  - 40k → save HANDOFF.md + Discord notify, continue\n  - 55k → save HANDOFF.md + Discord notify, STOP\n- Credit limits added ($10/day, $5/session behavioural stops)\n- Model discipline rules added (M2.5 for routine, Sonnet for analysis)\n- HANDOFF.md state save format standardised\n- Session Startup rule added: check HANDOFF.md before asking Rob what to do\n\n### 4. MiniMax Model Slug Fixed (`openclaw.json`)\n- Old slug: `openrouter/openai/minimax-m2.5` (wrong — caused \"model not allowed\" error)\n- New slug: `openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5` (correct OpenRouter path)\n- Updated in both `fallbacks` and `models` alias entries\n- Gateway restart pending approval (id: 77a26df7) — Rob needs to approve or manually restart\n\n### 5. Research Resumed (Partial)\n- Gameplans pricing: still opaque — homepage says \"covered by first client\", no public $ figure\n- Trustpilot reviews confirmed: Gameplans used for strategy/onboarding only, BAs go back to spreadsheets for acquisition\n- BA tech stack post-session: no definitive data found yet — generic CRM results (HubSpot, Zoho, Rex)\n- PropertyChat \"Tools of a Buyers Agent 2023\" thread URL found but not yet fetched\n- Rob instructed: NO outreach drafts, NO lead gen — pure research only\n\n---\n\n## Key Findings (Research)\n- Gameplans homepage lists major BA firms as users: Henderson, InvestorKit, Palise, Your Empire, Metropole, Property Principles, Actuate, Property Planning Australia\n- Arjun Paliwal (InvestorKit) is a Gameplans testimonial — they're a customer, not just a competitor\n- \"Equity notification\" = Gameplans most praised feature; PropPath must match and extend this\n- PropPath opportunity confirmed: everything AFTER the Gameplans strategy session is unaddressed\n\n---\n\n## Exact Next Actions (Resume Here)\n1. **Approve gateway restart** (approval id 77a26df7) or run `openclaw gateway restart` manually\n2. **Test MiniMax switch**: try `/model minimax-2.5` in webchat or Discord after restart\n3. **Continue research** — priority order:\n   a. Fetch PropertyChat \"Tools of a Buyers Agent 2023\" thread: https://www.propertychat.com.au/community/threads/tools-of-a-buyers-agent-2023.73954/\n   b. Gameplans pricing — try browser tool on gameplans.com.au/pricing (Cloudflare may block fetch)\n   c. BA tech stack post-session — what CRM/tools do BAs use for acquisition tracking?\n4. Update `memory/knowledge/competitor_software.md` with new Gameplans findings\n5. Update Google Sheet CompetitorIntel + ResearchLog tabs\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions / Blockers\n- Gameplans pricing unknown — may require demo booking or BA contact to get real number\n- MiniMax model switch untested until gateway restart approved\n- PropertyChat thread may be Cloudflare-blocked (was last session) — browser tool needed\n"}}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openrouter","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6","usage":{"input":60595,"output":1118,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":61713,"cost":{"input":0.181785,"output":0.01677,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.198555}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771738163932}}

Right-click your **own avatar** → **Copy User ID**\n\n    Save your **Server ID** and **User ID** alongside your Bot Token — you'll send all three to OpenClaw in the next step.\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Allow DMs from server members\">\n    For pairing to work, Discord needs to allow your bot to DM you. Right-click your **server icon** → **Privacy Settings** → toggle on **Direct Messages**.\n\n    This lets server members (including bots) send you DMs. Keep this enabled if you want to use Discord DMs with OpenClaw. If you only plan to use guild channels, you can disable DMs after pairing.\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Step 0: Set your bot token securely (do not send it in chat)\">\n    Your Discord bot token is a secret (like a password). Set it on the machine running OpenClaw before messaging your agent.\n\n```bash\nopenclaw config set channels.discord.token '\"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN\"' --json\nopenclaw config set channels.discord.enabled true --json\nopenclaw gateway\n```\n\n    If OpenClaw is already running as a background service, use `openclaw gateway restart` instead.\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Configure OpenClaw and pair\">\n\n    <Tabs>\n      <Tab title=\"Ask your agent\">\n        Chat with your OpenClaw agent on any existing channel (e.g. Telegram) and tell it. If Discord is your first channel, use the CLI / config tab instead.\n\n        > \"I already set my Discord bot token in config. Please finish Discord setup with User ID `<user_id>` and Server ID `<server_id>`.\"\n      </Tab>\n      <Tab title=\"CLI / config\">\n        If you prefer file-based config, set:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      enabled: true,\n      token: \"YOUR_BOT_TOKEN\",\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n        Env fallback for the default account:\n\n```bash\nDISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...\n```\n\n      </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Approve first DM pairing\">\n    Wait until the gateway is running, then DM your bot in Discord. It will respond with a pairing code.\n\n    <Tabs>\n      <Tab title=\"Ask your agent\">\n        Send the pairing code to your agent on your existing channel:\n\n        > \"Approve this Discord pairing code: `<CODE>`\"\n      </Tab>\n      <Tab title=\"CLI\">\n\n```bash\nopenclaw pairing list discord\nopenclaw pairing approve discord <CODE>\n```\n\n      </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n\n    Pairing codes expire after 1 hour.\n\n    You should now be able to chat with your agent in Discord via DM.\n\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\n<Note>\nToken resolution is account-aware. Config token values win over env fallback. `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is only used for the default account.\n</Note>\n\n## Recommended: Set up a guild workspace\n\nOnce DMs are working, you can set up your Discord server as a full workspace where each channel gets its own agent session with its own context. This is recommended for private servers where it's just you and your bot.\n\n<Steps>\n  <Step title=\"Add your server to the guild allowlist\">\n    This enables your agent to respond in any channel on your server, not just DMs.\n\n    <Tabs>\n      <Tab title=\"Ask your agent\">\n        > \"Add my Discord Server ID `<server_id>` to the guild allowlist\"\n      </Tab>\n      <Tab title=\"Config\">\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      groupPolicy: \"allowlist\",\n      guilds: {\n        YOUR_SERVER_ID: {\n          requireMention: true,\n          users: [\"YOUR_USER_ID\"],\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n      </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Allow responses without @mention\">\n    By default, your agent only responds in guild channels when @mentioned. For a private server, you probably want it to respond to every message.\n\n    <Tabs>\n      <Tab title=\"Ask your agent\">\n        > \"Allow my agent to respond on this server without having to be @mentioned\"\n      </Tab>\n      <Tab title=\"Config\">\n        Set `requireMention: false` in your guild config:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      guilds: {\n        YOUR_SERVER_ID: {\n          requireMention: false,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n      </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n\n  </Step>\n\n  <Step title=\"Plan for memory in guild channels\">\n    By default, long-term memory (MEMORY.md) only loads in DM sessions. Guild channels do not auto-load MEMORY.md.\n\n    <Tabs>\n      <Tab title=\"Ask your agent\">\n        > \"When I ask questions in Discord channels, use memory_search or memory_get if you need long-term context from MEMORY.md.\"\n      </Tab>\n      <Tab title=\"Manual\">\n        If you need shared context in every channel, put the stable instructions in `AGENTS.md` or `USER.md` (they are injected for every session). Keep long-term notes in `MEMORY.md` and access them on demand with memory tools.\n      </Tab>\n    </Tabs>\n\n  </Step>\n</Steps>\n\nNow create some channels on your Discord server and start chatting. Your agent can see the channel name, and each channel gets its own isolated session — so you can set up `#coding`, `#home`, `#research`, or whatever fits your workflow.\n\n## Runtime model\n\n- Gateway owns the Discord connection.\n- Reply routing is deterministic: Discord inbound replies back to Discord.\n- By default (`session.dmScope=main`), direct chats share the agent main session (`agent:main:main`).\n- Guild channels are isolated session keys (`agent:<agentId>:discord:channel:<channelId>`).\n- Group DMs are ignored by default (`channels.discord.dm.groupEnabled=false`).\n- Native slash commands run in isolated command sessions (`agent:<agentId>:discord:slash:<userId>`), while still carrying `CommandTargetSessionKey` to the routed conversation session.\n\n## Forum channels\n\nDiscord forum and media channels only accept thread posts. OpenClaw supports two ways to create them:\n\n- Send a message to the forum parent (`channel:<forumId>`) to auto-create a thread. The thread title uses the first non-empty line of your message.\n- Use `openclaw message thread create` to create a thread directly. Do not pass `--message-id` for forum channels.\n\nExample: send to forum parent to create a thread\n\n```bash\nopenclaw message send --channel discord --target channel:<forumId> \\\n  --message \"Topic title\\nBody of the post\"\n```\n\nExample: create a forum thread explicitly\n\n```bash\nopenclaw message thread create --channel discord --target channel:<forumId> \\\n  --thread-name \"Topic title\" --message \"Body of the post\"\n```\n\nForum parents do not accept Discord components. If you need components, send to the thread itself (`channel:<threadId>`).\n\n## Interactive components\n\nOpenClaw supports Discord components v2 containers for agent messages. Use the message tool with a `components` payload. Interaction results are routed back to the agent as normal inbound messages and follow the existing Discord `replyToMode` settings.\n\nSupported blocks:\n\n- `text`, `section`, `separator`, `actions`, `media-gallery`, `file`\n- Action rows allow up to 5 buttons or a single select menu\n- Select types: `string`, `user`, `role`, `mentionable`, `channel`\n\nBy default, components are single use. Set `components.reusable=true` to allow buttons, selects, and forms to be used multiple times until they expire.\n\nTo restrict who can click a button, set `allowedUsers` on that button (Discord user IDs, tags, or `*`). When configured, unmatched users receive an ephemeral denial.\n\nThe `/model` and `/models` slash commands open an interactive model picker with provider and model dropdowns plus a Submit step. The picker reply is ephemeral and only the invoking user can use it.\n\nFile attachments:\n\n- `file` blocks must point to an attachment reference (`attachment://<filename>`)\n- Provide the attachment via `media`/`path`/`filePath` (single file); use `media-gallery` for multiple files\n- Use `filename` to override the upload name when it should match the attachment reference\n\nModal forms:\n\n- Add `components.modal` with up to 5 fields\n- Field types: `text`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `select`, `role-select`, `user-select`\n- OpenClaw adds a trigger button automatically\n\nExample:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channel: \"discord\",\n  action: \"send\",\n  to: \"channel:123456789012345678\",\n  message: \"Optional fallback text\",\n  components: {\n    reusable: true,\n    text: \"Choose a path\",\n    blocks: [\n      {\n        type: \"actions\",\n        buttons: [\n          {\n            label: \"Approve\",\n            style: \"success\",\n            allowedUsers: [\"123456789012345678\"],\n          },\n          { label: \"Decline\", style: \"danger\" },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        type: \"actions\",\n        select: {\n          type: \"string\",\n          placeholder: \"Pick an option\",\n          options: [\n            { label: \"Option A\", value: \"a\" },\n            { label: \"Option B\", value: \"b\" },\n          ],\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n    modal: {\n      title: \"Details\",\n      triggerLabel: \"Open form\",\n      fields: [\n        { type: \"text\", label: \"Requester\" },\n        {\n          type: \"select\",\n          label: \"Priority\",\n          options: [\n            { label: \"Low\", value: \"low\" },\n            { label: \"High\", value: \"high\" },\n          ],\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Access control and routing\n\n<Tabs>\n  <Tab title=\"DM policy\">\n    `channels.discord.dmPolicy` controls DM access (legacy: `channels.discord.dm.policy`):\n\n    - `pairing` (default)\n    - `allowlist`\n    - `open` (requires `channels.discord.allowFrom` to include `\"*\"`; legacy: `channels.discord.dm.allowFrom`)\n    - `disabled`\n\n    If DM policy is not open, unknown users are blocked (or prompted for pairing in `pairing` mode).\n\n    DM target format for delivery:\n\n    - `user:<id>`\n    - `<@id>` mention\n\n    Bare numeric IDs are ambiguous and rejected unless an explicit user/channel target kind is provided.\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Guild policy\">\n    Guild handling is controlled by `channels.discord.groupPolicy`:\n\n    - `open`\n    - `allowlist`\n    - `disabled`\n\n    Secure baseline when `channels.discord` exists is `allowlist`.\n\n    `allowlist` behavior:\n\n    - guild must match `channels.discord.guilds` (`id` preferred, slug accepted)\n    - optional sender allowlists: `users` (IDs or names) and `roles` (role IDs only); if either is configured, senders are allowed when they match `users` OR `roles`\n    - if a guild has `channels` configured, non-listed channels are denied\n    - if a guild has no `channels` block, all channels in that allowlisted guild are allowed\n\n    Example:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      groupPolicy: \"allowlist\",\n      guilds: {\n        \"123456789012345678\": {\n          requireMention: true,\n          users: [\"987654321098765432\"],\n          roles: [\"123456789012345678\"],\n          channels: {\n            general: { allow: true },\n            help: { allow: true, requireMention: true },\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n    If you only set `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` and do not create a `channels.discord` block, runtime fallback is `groupPolicy=\"open\"` (with a warning in logs).\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab title=\"Mentions and group DMs\">\n    Guild messages are mention-gated by default.\n\n    Mention detection includes:\n\n    - explicit bot mention\n    - configured mention patterns (`agents.list[].groupChat.mentionPatterns`, fallback `messages.groupChat.mentionPatterns`)\n    - implicit reply-to-bot behavior in supported cases\n\n    `requireMention` is configured per guild/channel (`channels.discord.guilds...`).\n\n    Group DMs:\n\n    - default: ignored (`dm.groupEnabled=false`)\n    - optional allowlist via `dm.groupChannels` (channel IDs or slugs)\n\n  </Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Role-based agent routing\n\nUse `bindings[].match.roles` to route Discord guild members to different agents by role ID. Role-based bindings accept role IDs only and are evaluated after peer or parent-peer bindings and before guild-only bindings. If a binding also sets other match fields (for example `peer` + `guildId` + `roles`), all configured fields must match.\n\n```json5\n{\n  bindings: [\n    {\n      agentId: \"opus\",\n      match: {\n        channel: \"discord\",\n        guildId: \"123456789012345678\",\n        roles: [\"111111111111111111\"],\n      },\n    },\n    {\n      agentId: \"sonnet\",\n      match: {\n        channel: \"discord\",\n        guildId: \"123456789012345678\",\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Developer Portal setup\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Create app and bot\">\n\n    1.

Explicit `[[reply_to_*]]` tags are still honored.\n\n    Message IDs are surfaced in context/history so agents can target specific messages.\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Live stream preview\">\n    OpenClaw can stream draft replies by sending a temporary message and editing it as text arrives.\n\n    - `channels.discord.streamMode` controls preview streaming (`off` | `partial` | `block`, default: `off`).\n    - `partial` edits a single preview message as tokens arrive.\n    - `block` emits draft-sized chunks (use `draftChunk` to tune size and breakpoints).\n\n    Example:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      streamMode: \"partial\",\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n    `block` mode chunking defaults (clamped to `channels.discord.textChunkLimit`):\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      streamMode: \"block\",\n      draftChunk: {\n        minChars: 200,\n        maxChars: 800,\n        breakPreference: \"paragraph\",\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n    Preview streaming is text-only; media replies fall back to normal delivery.\n\n    Note: preview streaming is separate from block streaming. When block streaming is explicitly\n    enabled for Discord, OpenClaw skips the preview stream to avoid double streaming.\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"History, context, and thread behavior\">\n    Guild history context:\n\n    - `channels.discord.historyLimit` default `20`\n    - fallback: `messages.groupChat.historyLimit`\n    - `0` disables\n\n    DM history controls:\n\n    - `channels.discord.dmHistoryLimit`\n    - `channels.discord.dms[\"<user_id>\"].historyLimit`\n\n    Thread behavior:\n\n    - Discord threads are routed as channel sessions\n    - parent thread metadata can be used for parent-session linkage\n    - thread config inherits parent channel config unless a thread-specific entry exists\n\n    Channel topics are injected as **untrusted** context (not as system prompt).\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Reaction notifications\">\n    Per-guild reaction notification mode:\n\n    - `off`\n    - `own` (default)\n    - `all`\n    - `allowlist` (uses `guilds.<id>.users`)\n\n    Reaction events are turned into system events and attached to the routed Discord session.\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Ack reactions\">\n    `ackReaction` sends an acknowledgement emoji while OpenClaw is processing an inbound message.\n\n    Resolution order:\n\n    - `channels.discord.accounts.<accountId>.ackReaction`\n    - `channels.discord.ackReaction`\n    - `messages.ackReaction`\n    - agent identity emoji fallback (`agents.list[].identity.emoji`, else \"👀\")\n\n    Notes:\n\n    - Discord accepts unicode emoji or custom emoji names.\n    - Use `\"\"` to disable the reaction for a channel or account.\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Config writes\">\n    Channel-initiated config writes are enabled by default.\n\n    This affects `/config set|unset` flows (when command features are enabled).\n\n    Disable:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      configWrites: false,\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Gateway proxy\">\n    Route Discord gateway WebSocket traffic and startup REST lookups (application ID + allowlist resolution) through an HTTP(S) proxy with `channels.discord.proxy`.\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      proxy: \"http://proxy.example:8080\",\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n    Per-account override:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      accounts: {\n        primary: {\n          proxy: \"http://proxy.example:8080\",\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"PluralKit support\">\n    Enable PluralKit resolution to map proxied messages to system member identity:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      pluralkit: {\n        enabled: true,\n        token: \"pk_live_...\", // optional; needed for private systems\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n    Notes:\n\n    - allowlists can use `pk:<memberId>`\n    - member display names are matched by name/slug\n    - lookups use original message ID and are time-window constrained\n    - if lookup fails, proxied messages are treated as bot messages and dropped unless `allowBots=true`\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Presence configuration\">\n    Presence updates are applied only when you set a status or activity field.\n\n    Status only example:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      status: \"idle\",\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n    Activity example (custom status is the default activity type):\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      activity: \"Focus time\",\n      activityType: 4,\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n    Streaming example:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      activity: \"Live coding\",\n      activityType: 1,\n      activityUrl: \"https://twitch.tv/openclaw\",\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n    Activity type map:\n\n    - 0: Playing\n    - 1: Streaming (requires `activityUrl`)\n    - 2: Listening\n    - 3: Watching\n    - 4: Custom (uses the activity text as the status state; emoji is optional)\n    - 5: Competing\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Exec approvals in Discord\">\n    Discord supports button-based exec approvals in DMs and can optionally post approval prompts in the originating channel.\n\n    Config path:\n\n    - `channels.discord.execApprovals.enabled`\n    - `channels.discord.execApprovals.approvers`\n    - `channels.discord.execApprovals.target` (`dm` | `channel` | `both`, default: `dm`)\n    - `agentFilter`, `sessionFilter`, `cleanupAfterResolve`\n\n    When `target` is `channel` or `both`, the approval prompt is visible in the channel. Only configured approvers can use the buttons; other users receive an ephemeral denial. Approval prompts include the command text, so only enable channel delivery in trusted channels. If the channel ID cannot be derived from the session key, OpenClaw falls back to DM delivery.\n\n    If approvals fail with unknown approval IDs, verify approver list and feature enablement.\n\n    Related docs: [Exec approvals](/tools/exec-approvals)\n\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n## Tools and action gates\n\nDiscord message actions include messaging, channel admin, moderation, presence, and metadata actions.\n\nCore examples:\n\n- messaging: `sendMessage`, `readMessages`, `editMessage`, `deleteMessage`, `threadReply`\n- reactions: `react`, `reactions`, `emojiList`\n- moderation: `timeout`, `kick`, `ban`\n- presence: `setPresence`\n\nAction gates live under `channels.discord.actions.*`.\n\nDefault gate behavior:\n\n| Action group                                                                                                                                                             | Default  |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |\n| reactions, messages, threads, pins, polls, search, memberInfo, roleInfo, channelInfo, channels, voiceStatus, events, stickers, emojiUploads, stickerUploads, permissions | enabled  |\n| roles                                                                                                                                                                    | disabled |\n| moderation                                                                                                                                                               | disabled |\n| presence                                                                                                                                                                 | disabled |\n\n## Components v2 UI\n\nOpenClaw uses Discord components v2 for exec approvals and cross-context markers. Discord message actions can also accept `components` for custom UI (advanced; requires Carbon component instances), while legacy `embeds` remain available but are not recommended.\n\n- `channels.discord.ui.components.accentColor` sets the accent color used by Discord component containers (hex).\n- Set per account with `channels.discord.accounts.<id>.ui.components.accentColor`.\n- `embeds` are ignored when components v2 are present.\n\nExample:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      ui: {\n        components: {\n          accentColor: \"#5865F2\",\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\n## Voice channels\n\nOpenClaw can join Discord voice channels for realtime, continuous conversations. This is separate from voice message attachments.\n\nRequirements:\n\n- Enable native commands (`commands.native` or `channels.discord.commands.native`).\n- Configure `channels.discord.voice`.\n- The bot needs Connect + Speak permissions in the target voice channel.\n\nUse the Discord-only native command `/vc join|leave|status` to control sessions. The command uses the account default agent and follows the same allowlist and group policy rules as other Discord commands.\n\nAuto-join example:\n\n```json5\n{\n  channels: {\n    discord: {\n      voice: {\n        enabled: true,\n        autoJoin: [\n          {\n            guildId: \"123456789012345678\",\n            channelId: \"234567890123456789\",\n          },\n        ],\n        tts: {\n          provider: \"openai\",\n          openai: { voice: \"alloy\" },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n}\n```\n\nNotes:\n\n- `voice.tts` overrides `messages.tts` for voice playback only.\n- Voice is enabled by default; set `channels.discord.voice.enabled=false` to disable it.\n\n## Voice messages\n\nDiscord voice messages show a waveform preview and require OGG/Opus audio plus metadata. OpenClaw generates the waveform automatically, but it needs `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` available on the gateway host to inspect and convert audio files.\n\nRequirements and constraints:\n\n- Provide a **local file path** (URLs are rejected).\n- Omit text content (Discord does not allow text + voice message in the same payload).\n- Any audio format is accepted; OpenClaw converts to OGG/Opus when needed.\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\nmessage(action=\"send\", channel=\"discord\", target=\"channel:123\", path=\"/path/to/audio.mp3\", asVoice=true)\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n<AccordionGroup>\n  <Accordion title=\"Used disallowed intents or bot sees no guild messages\">\n\n    - enable Message Content Intent\n    - enable Server Members Intent when you depend on user/member resolution\n    - restart gateway after changing intents\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Guild messages blocked unexpectedly\">\n\n    - verify `groupPolicy`\n    - verify guild allowlist under `channels.discord.guilds`\n    - if guild `channels` map exists, only listed channels are allowed\n    - verify `requireMention` behavior and mention patterns\n\n    Useful checks:\n\n```bash\nopenclaw doctor\nopenclaw channels status --probe\nopenclaw logs --follow\n```\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Require mention false but still blocked\">\n    Common causes:\n\n    - `groupPolicy=\"allowlist\"` without matching guild/channel allowlist\n    - `requireMention` configured in the wrong place (must be under `channels.discord.guilds` or channel entry)\n    - sender blocked by guild/channel `users` allowlist\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Permissions audit mismatches\">\n    `channels status --probe` permission checks only work for numeric channel IDs.\n\n    If you use slug keys, runtime matching can still work, but probe cannot fully verify permissions.\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"DM and pairing issues\">\n\n    - DM disabled: `channels.discord.dm.enabled=false`\n    - DM policy disabled: `channels.discord.dmPolicy=\"disabled\"` (legacy: `channels.discord.dm.policy`)\n    - awaiting pairing approval in `pairing` mode\n\n  </Accordion>\n\n  <Accordion title=\"Bot to bot loops\">\n    By default bot-authored messages are ignored.\n\n    If you set `channels.discord.allowBots=true`, use strict mention and allowlist rules to avoid loop behavior.\n\n  </Accordion>\n</AccordionGroup>\n\n## Configuration reference pointers\n\nPrimary reference:\n\n- [Configuration reference - Discord](/gateway/configuration-reference#discord)\n\nHigh-signal Discord fields:\n\n- startup/auth: `enabled`, `token`, `accounts.*`, `allowBots`\n- policy: `groupPolicy`, `dm.*`, `guilds.*`, `guilds.*.channels.*`\n- command: `commands.native`, `commands.useAccessGroups`, `configWrites`, `slashCommand.*`\n- reply/history: `replyToMode`, `historyLimit`, `dmHistoryLimit`, `dms.*.historyLimit`\n- delivery: `textChunkLimit`, `chunkMode`, `maxLinesPerMessage`\n- streaming: `streamMode`, `draftChunk`, `blockStreaming`, `blockStreamingCoalesce`\n- media/retry: `mediaMaxMb`, `retry`\n- actions: `actions.*`\n- presence: `activity`, `status`, `activityType`, `activityUrl`\n- UI: `ui.components.accentColor`\n- features: `pluralkit`, `execApprovals`, `intents`, `agentComponents`, `heartbeat`, `responsePrefix`\n\n## Safety and operations\n\n- Treat bot tokens as secrets (`DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` preferred in supervised environments).\n- Grant least-privilege Discord permissions.\n- If command deploy/state is stale, restart gateway and re-check with `openclaw channels status --probe`.\n\n## Related\n\n- [Pairing](/channels/pairing)\n- [Channel routing](/channels/channel-routing)\n- [Multi-agent routing](/concepts/multi-agent)\n- [Troubleshooting](/channels/troubleshooting)\n- [Slash commands](/tools/slash-commands)\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771738637341}}
