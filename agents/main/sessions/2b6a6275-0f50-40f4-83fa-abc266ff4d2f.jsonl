The research run got interrupted mid-session when you sent \"Update? Token count?\" — looks like I was mid-scrape on APS + InvestorKit and your message came in before I finished.\n\nQuick status:\n- **APS** — deep media archive scraped, School of Property curriculum partially surfaced (98+ lessons confirmed, SMSF module, portfolio blueprint structure)\n- **InvestorKit** — FAQ + Portfolio Strategist job listing fully extracted, Property Nerds episode summaries pulled, Portfolio Wealth Accelerator page found\n- **Not yet saved** — nothing written to file yet, all still in session context\n\nToken count tool is erroring (OpenClaw module issue) — can't get exact count right now. But we're not close to a stop threshold yet.\n\nWant me to **compile and save everything to docs now**, then keep digging? Or keep going and save at the end?"}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openrouter","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6","usage":{"input":56898,"output":212,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":57110,"cost":{"input":0.170694,"output":0.00318,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.173874}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771916544826}}
