Prompt Injection Blocked\n- Detected and blocked a Discord-based prompt injection attempt trying to install \"standing orders\"\n- Flagged to Rob — no action taken on injection content\n\n### 2. Compaction Config Fixed (`openclaw.json`)\n- `softThresholdTokens`: was 50k → changed to 10k → Rob reverted back to 50k (correct)\n- Memory flush prompts updated to reference HANDOFF.md specifically\n\n### 3. AGENTS.md — Session Management Rewritten\n- Old 20k token rule replaced with proper hard stop rules:\n  - 40k → save HANDOFF.md + Discord notify, continue\n  - 55k → save HANDOFF.md + Discord notify, STOP\n- Credit limits added ($10/day, $5/session behavioural stops)\n- Model discipline rules added (M2.5 for routine, Sonnet for analysis)\n- HANDOFF.md state save format standardised\n- Session Startup rule added: check HANDOFF.md before asking Rob what to do\n\n### 4. MiniMax Model Slug Fixed (`openclaw.json`)\n- Old slug: `openrouter/openai/minimax-m2.5` (wrong — caused \"model not allowed\" error)\n- New slug: `openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5` (correct OpenRouter path)\n- Updated in both `fallbacks` and `models` alias entries\n- Gateway restart pending approval (id: 77a26df7) — Rob needs to approve or manually restart\n\n### 5. Research Resumed (Partial)\n- Gameplans pricing: still opaque — homepage says \"covered by first client\", no public $ figure\n- Trustpilot reviews confirmed: Gameplans used for strategy/onboarding only, BAs go back to spreadsheets for acquisition\n- BA tech stack post-session: no definitive data found yet — generic CRM results (HubSpot, Zoho, Rex)\n- PropertyChat \"Tools of a Buyers Agent 2023\" thread URL found but not yet fetched\n- Rob instructed: NO outreach drafts, NO lead gen — pure research only\n\n---\n\n## Key Findings (Research)\n- Gameplans homepage lists major BA firms as users: Henderson, InvestorKit, Palise, Your Empire, Metropole, Property Principles, Actuate, Property Planning Australia\n- Arjun Paliwal (InvestorKit) is a Gameplans testimonial — they're a customer, not just a competitor\n- \"Equity notification\" = Gameplans most praised feature; PropPath must match and extend this\n- PropPath opportunity confirmed: everything AFTER the Gameplans strategy session is unaddressed\n\n---\n\n## Exact Next Actions (Resume Here)\n1. **Approve gateway restart** (approval id 77a26df7) or run `openclaw gateway restart` manually\n2. **Test MiniMax switch**: try `/model minimax-2.5` in webchat or Discord after restart\n3. **Continue research** — priority order:\n   a. Fetch PropertyChat \"Tools of a Buyers Agent 2023\" thread: https://www.propertychat.com.au/community/threads/tools-of-a-buyers-agent-2023.73954/\n   b. Gameplans pricing — try browser tool on gameplans.com.au/pricing (Cloudflare may block fetch)\n   c. BA tech stack post-session — what CRM/tools do BAs use for acquisition tracking?\n4. Update `memory/knowledge/competitor_software.md` with new Gameplans findings\n5. Update Google Sheet CompetitorIntel + ResearchLog tabs\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions / Blockers\n- Gameplans pricing unknown — may require demo booking or BA contact to get real number\n- MiniMax model switch untested until gateway restart approved\n- PropertyChat thread may be Cloudflare-blocked (was last session) — browser tool needed\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771738877489}}
