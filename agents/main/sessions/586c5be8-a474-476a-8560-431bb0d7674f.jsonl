MiniMax Model Confirmed Working ✅\n- Rob switched to minimax-2.5 — confirmed working\n- Config slug `openrouter/minimax/minimax-m2.5` is correct\n\n### 2. PropertyChat \"Tools of a Buyers Agent 2023\" Thread — FETCHED ✅\nURL: https://www.propertychat.com.au/community/threads/tools-of-a-buyers-agent-2023.73954/\n\n**Key findings:**\n- **Monday.com** — most popular BA CRM (free + paid versions)\n- **Trello** — day-to-day task management\n- **WhatsApp groups** — client comms + off-market agent deal flow\n- **MailChimp** (free) + **Cellcast** (pay-per-text) — bulk agent outreach\n- **Docusign** — contracts/e-signatures\n- **RP Data, Pricefinder** — due diligence/property data\n- **Chrome extension** (Homer/KoalaData via REBAA) — price estimates on realestate.com.au\n- **Xero** — accounting\n- **Pattern:** No dedicated BA portfolio tracker. Generic tools cobbled together. Spreadsheets fill the gap.\n\n### 3. Gameplans Pricing — PARTIAL ✅\n- /pricing page broken (error)\n- Strategy session pricing (what BAs charge clients): **$1,100–$2,200 GST incl** (Master Advocates), some charge **$2K–$5K+**\n- Software subscription: **not publicly listed** — opaque, must book demo\n- Cloudflare blocked Capterra/SoftwareAdvice review pages\n\n### 4. NEW COMPETITOR DISCOVERED: Open BA 🚨\nURL: https://openba.com.au\n\n**Critical intel — this is a DIRECT competitor to PropPath:**\n\n**What it does:**\n- AI automation platform specifically for Australian Buyers Agents\n- Agent outreach (email, SMS, call)\n- Property sourcing (on-market + off-portal/pre-market listings)\n- AI property reviews scored against client brief\n- Workflow automation\n- Client portal (shortlist sharing + client comments)\n- Team collaboration\n- Daily market snapshot\n- Chrome extension for sourcing\n- Bulk SMS integration (add-on)\n- Integrates with: **HTAG** (data), **SystemsDU**\n\n**Pricing (CONFIRMED):**\n- **Essentials: $129/member/month** — agent outreach, up to 10 active briefs, daily snapshot, custom domain emails, AI property reviews\n- **Business: $299/member/month** — everything in Essentials + off-portal listings, unlimited briefs, branding, team collab, client portal (shortlist/sold), Chrome extension, bulk SMS\n- **Enterprise: contact for pricing** — custom CRM integrations, dedicated AM, priority support, custom AI search, custom workflows\n\n**Users (confirmed from testimonials):**\n- Actuate Property (Adam Fahey) — also a Gameplans customer!\n- Unicorn Buyers Agents (Dan Sofo) — 3-person team, saves 5–10h/week\n- Marsden Buyers Agents (Dion Marsden)\n- Momentum Buyers Agents (Nadene Anderson)\n- Investr (JP Ghabriel)\n- Buyers First Agency (Dan White)\n- Domain & Co (Warwick Brookes)\n- Brisbane BA managing 18+ concurrent briefs\n- Veronica Morgan\n\n**Key quotes:**\n- \"Reduced outreach time to agents by 30%\" — Dan Sofo, Unicorn\n- \"Saves me hours every week and directly helps me generate revenue. Sourcing is my bottleneck and Open BA fixes this!\" — JP Ghabriel\n- \"I was able to reduce a team member because of what it can do.\" — Warwick Brookes\n- \"Since coming on board, we've seen multiple success stories - outreaches that have led directly to off-market purchases\" — Dion Marsden\n\n**Team background:** Founders from Domain, Rokt, Airtasker, Zip\n\n**Key differentiator vs PropPath:**\n- Open BA = SOURCING + WORKFLOW (finding properties, agent outreach, pre-market access)\n- PropPath = PORTFOLIO PLANNING + VISUALISATION (what to buy, when, in what order — the strategic layer)\n- Open BA fills the acquisition execution gap; PropPath fills the portfolio strategy gap\n- They are potentially COMPLEMENTARY not directly competing — but overlap in client portal/shortlisting\n\n### 5. HTAG — Partially Researched\n- Property data + analytics platform for Australian property professionals\n- Has \"Portfolio Modelling\" feature for buyers agents\n- Partnered with Open BA (integration link on Open BA site)\n- Has Buyers Agent Directory (for Professional/Elite subscribers after 6 months)\n- Pricing: **not yet fetched** (Cloudflare blocked)\n- Services page: machine learning models covering 5,000+ local markets\n\n### 6. RealEstateInvestar Portfolio Tracker — Noted\n- Portfolio tracker included in all plans\n- Tracks: market values, capital growth, equity, income, cash flow, expenses, tax\n- Aimed at individual investors, not BAs managing client portfolios\n- Pricing: see /pricing page — not yet fetched\n\n---\n\n## Key Strategic Findings\n\n### The BA Tech Stack Map (confirmed)\n| Phase | Tools Used |\n|-------|-----------|\n| Strategy/planning | Gameplans |\n| CRM/pipeline | Monday.com, some HubSpot |\n| Agent outreach | Open BA, MailChimp, Cellcast |\n| Property sourcing | Open BA, HTAG, RP Data, Pricefinder |\n| Client comms | WhatsApp, Open BA client portal |\n| Contracts | Docusign |\n| Accounting | Xero |\n| **Portfolio tracking** | **NOTHING dedicated — spreadsheets** |\n\n### PropPath Positioning\n- Gameplans = strategy session (Phase 1)\n- Open BA = acquisition execution (Phase 2 — sourcing/outreach)\n- **PropPath = portfolio planning layer (sits between/above both)**\n- PropPath should show: \"what to buy next, why, and in what order\" — the ongoing portfolio roadmap\n- Open BA is NOT a direct competitor — they solve sourcing. PropPath solves planning.\n- Potential partnership angle: Gameplans → PropPath → Open BA workflow\n\n---\n\n## Exact Next Actions (Resume Here)\n1. **Fetch HTAG pricing** — https://www.htag.com.au/services/ (use browser, site blocks fetch)\n2. **Fetch RealEstateInvestar pricing** — https://www.realestateinvestar.com.au/pricing\n3. **Research SystemsDU** — Open BA integration partner, unknown what it does\n4. **Update memory/knowledge/competitor_software.md** with all findings from this session\n5. **Update Google Sheet** — CompetitorIntel + ResearchLog tabs\n6. **Draft competitive positioning doc** for PropPath vs Open BA vs Gameplans\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions / Blockers\n- HTAG pricing: unknown — site Cloudflare-blocked for fetch, need browser\n- Gameplans software price: still unknown\n- SystemsDU: unknown tool — needs research\n- Are Actuate/Unicorn/Marsden also Gameplans users? (Actuate confirmed yes) — overlap of customers = validation of PropPath opportunity\n"}}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openrouter","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6","usage":{"input":64513,"output":2147,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":66660,"cost":{"input":0.19353900000000002,"output":0.032205,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.225744}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771740806438}}
