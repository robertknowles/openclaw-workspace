Compiled Master Feature Map ✅\n- `memory/knowledge/proppath-feature-map.md` — full PropPath feature map, Tier 1–4, Gameplans gap table\n- Sourced from all 5 knowledge docs\n\n### 2. PropPath Model Statement ✅\n- `memory/knowledge/proppath-model-statement.md` — critical calibration doc\n- Rob's framing: \"PropPath is incremental, not simulation-first\"\n- Defines InvestorKit model vs Gameplans model, correct audit questions, wrong audit questions\n- Also saved as `memory/knowledge/property-investment/06-investorkit-vs-gameplans-model.md`\n\n### 3. Rob's Direction Mid-Session\n- Rob said: **stop comparing to PropPath for now — do a pure InvestorKit deep dive**\n- Then confirmed: APS deep media archive (98+ lessons, SMSF module, curriculum) and InvestorKit FAQ/Portfolio Strategist job/Property Nerds episodes were NOT properly saved from a prior session\n- Asked to run both in tandem\n\n---\n\n## Current Active Task: Two-Track Research (MID-FLIGHT, NOT YET SAVED)\n\n### Track A — InvestorKit Deep Dive\n\n**Raw data fetched this session, NOT yet written to files:**\n\n#### InvestorKit FAQ (full content retrieved) — Key findings:\n- Buys in 9–15 markets at any time\n- Does NOT buy: new builds, NDIS, units/apartments, knockdown rebuilds, major renovation properties\n- Entry requirements: ~$100k equity/funds minimum; residential min $525k, SMSF min $575k; commercial $2M–$10M+\n- SMSF and Trust purchases: yes, they do both\n- Timeline to purchase: 1–4 months depending on brief specificity\n- Post-purchase: regular check-ins + **annual reviews with strategist**\n- Service includes: Portfolio Assessment, Property Brief Creation, Market Selection, Property Sourcing, Ongoing Support, Post-Purchase Reviews\n\n#### Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate (confirmed from SPI article, June 2024):\n- Arjun Paliwal explicitly laid this out on The Property Nerds podcast\n- Key quote: \"acquire, optimise, and consolidate\" — the cycle for scaling portfolios\n- Context: balance aggressive wealth building with enjoying life (personal note from Arjun in that episode)\n\n#### Portfolio Wealth Accelerator page:\n- URL: `investorkit.com.au/campaign/ultimate-property-toolkit/portfolio-wealth-accelerator/`\n- Now redirects to homepage — page is gone/archived\n- Snippet captured: *\"acquire properties in a strategic manner that may give you a security net and potentially help you jump from one property to another fast and compounds with time, increasing passive income\"*\n- This was a content/campaign page, NOT a software product page — now confirmed PWA is a content framework, not a standalone tool\n\n#### InvestorKit Portfolio Stage Framework (confirmed from Raj & Sowji case study):\nThree explicit stages used with clients:\n1. **Foundation** — major market, larger price points (blue chip capital city assets)\n2. **Momentum** — affordable prices, spread across the nation, data-driven location (any city)\n3. **Passive** — commercial and unit blocks for cash flow (\"forward moving assets — you don't take one step back, two steps forward\")\n\nQuote: *\"Assets where you don't take one step back, two steps forward like in residential. You simply take a step forward as cash flow is present from day one and growth continues to accumulate in the remainder of the portfolio.\"*\n\n#### Success Stories Scraped:\n- **Michael** — 13 properties, $16.54M, $2.8M equity in 5 years, 5 states, residential → commercial. Key: \"foundational residential → momentum regional → commercial\"\n- **Raj & Sowji** — 8 properties, $9M+, 4 states. Foundation → Momentum → now moving to commercial passive assets\n- **Dani & Ron** — 4 assets, $3.5M, 4 years, rentvesting\n- **Lorna** — 1 to 5 properties in 2.5 years\n- **Daniel** — 7 purchases, 4 states, 4 years\n\n#### Property Nerds Podcast:\n- Hosts: Arjun Paliwal (InvestorKit), Jack Fouracre (Fouracre Financial), Adrian (Senior Portfolio Strategist, InvestorKit)\n- Published on Smart Property Investment network AND standalone feed\n- Episode list not yet fully scraped — Apple Podcasts page returned limited content\n\n---\n\n### Track B — School of Property (APS) Curriculum\n\n**Raw data fetched this session, NOT yet written to files:**\n\n#### What's confirmed:\n- **12 modules** confirmed (from search snippet: \"12 modules with sharp and practical videos\")\n- Platform: Kajabi (schoolofproperty.mykajabi.com)\n- Lifetime access to all content including new additions\n- Includes: resource libraries, expert panel access, course portal\n- Positioning: \"gold standard in property investment education\"\n- Designed for beginners to experts — \"a clear, results-driven roadmap\"\n\n#### What's NOT yet retrieved:\n- Full module/lesson list (the 98+ lessons figure from prior session is unverified in current files)\n- SMSF module specifics\n- Portfolio blueprint structure details\n- Pricing\n\n#### APS Media page found:\n- `australianpropertyscout.com.au/media/` — Sam appeared with Jimmy to break down curriculum outline\n- This is likely the richest source for the full lesson breakdown — **NOT YET FETCHED**\n\n---\n\n## Exact Next Actions (Resume Here)\n\n### Priority 1 — Write up InvestorKit findings to file\nSave everything from Track A above into updated `memory/knowledge/competitors/05-investorkit.md`:\n- Full FAQ content\n- Three-stage framework (Foundation → Momentum → Passive) with Raj & Sowji quotes\n- Michael case study detail (foundation → momentum → commercial journey)\n- Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate confirmation + context\n- Portfolio Wealth Accelerator clarification (content framework, not software)\n- Annual reviews confirmed as standard (not monthly — FAQ says \"annual\")\n\n### Priority 2 — Fetch APS media page for curriculum breakdown\nURL: `australianpropertyscout.com.au/media/`\nThen fetch: `schoolofproperty.com.au/what-we-do/` and `schoolofproperty.com.au/homework-page/`\nGoal: get the 12 module names + lesson structure, confirm 98+ lessons figure, SMSF module\n\n### Priority 3 — Property Nerds episode list\nFetch full episode archive from InvestorKit podcast page or Apple Podcasts\nGoal: list of episode topics → what strategies/issues IK addresses in their content\n\n### Priority 4 — Pure InvestorKit synthesis doc\nRob wants a deep IK doc with NO PropPath lens.\nWrite: `memory/knowledge/property-investment/07-investorkit-pure-deep-dive.md`\nShould cover: business model, team structure, client lifecycle, three-stage framework, Acquire/Optimise/Consolidate, FAQ intel, case study patterns, what IK clients actually experience end-to-end\n\n---\n\n## Open Questions (Rob Has Not Answered Yet)\n- Does Rob want the pure IK doc first, or the files saved first?\n- Does Rob want to go deeper on The Property Nerds episode topics?\n- Next task after IK deep dive — return to PropPath feature map, or something else?\n\n---\n\n## Files Written This Session\n- `memory/knowledge/proppath-feature-map.md` ✅\n- `memory/knowledge/proppath-model-statement.md` ✅\n- `memory/knowledge/property-investment/06-investorkit-vs-gameplans-model.md` ✅\n- `memory/knowledge/HANDOFF.md` (this file) ✅\n\n## Files Pending Write (raw data in session, not yet saved)\n- InvestorKit FAQ content → needs to go into `competitors/05-investorkit.md`\n- Three-stage framework + case studies → same\n- School of Property 12 modules confirmation → `property-investment/04b-aps-deep-dive.md` update\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771918901579}}

Uses Gameplans tool.*\n*Research date: Feb 2026*\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\n- **Full name:** InvestorKit\n- **Website:** investorkit.com.au\n- **Founder/CEO:** Arjun Paliwal — ex-Commonwealth Bank, left at 26 with 9 investment properties\n- **Founded:** 2018\n- **Awards:** REB Buyers Agency of the Year 2023 AND 2024 (two years running — only agency to do this)\n- **Revenue:** ~$15M in 2024-25 (up from $7.6M in 2023-24 and $3.6M in 2022-23) — nearly doubling YoY\n- **Forecast:** $23–25M in 2025-26\n- **Staff:** 80+ full-time across InvestorKit Group\n- **Clients:** 1,200+ families\n- **Reviews:** 700+ 5-star reviews\n- **Podcast:** The Property Nerds (with Arjun Paliwal + co-hosts)\n- **Profile:** Featured in Forbes Australia (Aug 2025), 1000+ media articles\n\n---\n\n## What Makes InvestorKit Different\n\n### 1. Data-First, Research-Led Approach\n- Proprietary suburb-selection and investment modelling frameworks\n- In-house research team identifies markets BEFORE the curve\n- Rejects 92% of properties reviewed — only 8% pass due diligence\n- 20-point due diligence checklist for every property\n- 70% of deals sourced offline (not on major listing portals)\n- Buying in 9–15 markets at any given time\n- Has outperformed the national property market by 49%+ every year since inception\n\n### 2. Private Banking Model (Segmented Team)\nArjun deliberately modelled IK on CBA's private banking structure:\n- **Portfolio Strategist** — strategy sessions, buyer briefs, client lifecycle management\n- **Research Team** — suburb selection, market data\n- **Acquisitions Team** — negotiations, sourcing\n- **Client Success/Onboarding** — post-purchase support, annual reviews\n- Each client has one point of contact but accesses a team of specialists\n\n### 3. National + Remote\n- No local offices — fully remote/national\n- Active across all Australian states\n- \"Borderless investing approach\"\n\n---\n\n## The Portfolio Mapping Session — THE CRITICAL FEATURE\n\nThis is IK's core tool/process. Most similar to what PropPath does.\n\n### What it is (from job description):\n> \"Conduct high-quality portfolio mapping sessions tailored to each client's goals and investment profile. Collaborate with brokers and acquisitions teams to generate accurate, actionable buyer briefs.\"\n\n### What happens in a Portfolio Mapping Session:\n1. Understand financial goals, investment experience, risk profile\n2. Build a \"tailored brief\" — targets yield, capital growth, or cash flow balance\n3. **Generate a portfolio plan** — forward-looking roadmap showing long-term impact\n4. Collaborate with broker to validate borrowing capacity\n5. Produce a \"buyer brief\" that drives acquisition\n\n### What the Portfolio Plan produces (from case study):\n> \"Using their portfolio plan with InvestorKit, they can see the long term impact. The properties alone are on track to support an inflation adjusted passive income target above $100,000 per year in retirement, before including super.\"\n\n**This is a visual/modelled roadmap** — not just a conversation. It projects:\n- Portfolio value trajectory\n- Passive income at target date (e.g. retirement)\n- Inflation-adjusted projections\n- Multi-property, multi-state view\n\n### Portfolio Strategist role (from job posting — reveals what the tool does):\n- Conduct portfolio mapping sessions\n- Maintain CRM records (tasks, notes, stage tracking)\n- **Lead monthly client review sessions** — ongoing, not just point-in-time\n- Identify upsell opportunities (strategy → full service, or residential → commercial)\n- Support clients through property rejections\n- \"Provide timely and ongoing strategic guidance to existing clients to support repeat purchases\"\n\n**KEY INSIGHT:** IK has *ongoing* monthly client reviews — not just a one-off session. The Portfolio Strategist nurtures the client between purchases. This is where the living roadmap happens — but it's human-delivered, not software-delivered.\n\n---\n\n## The Portfolio Wealth Accelerator\n\nMentioned in their campaign URL. From the snippet:\n> \"This mapping technology enables me to continuously monitor the performance of my portfolio and make informed decisions based on valuable insights. Clients of InvestorKit have also benefited from utilising this tool during their journey with our Buyer's Agents to enhance their investment strategies.\"\n\n**This is almost certainly Gameplans** (or a similar tool) being used:\n- \"Mapping technology\" = visual portfolio modelling\n- \"Continuously monitor performance\" = ongoing tracking\n- \"Clients have benefited from utilising this tool during their journey\" = client-facing during sessions\n\n**IK uses Gameplans as their Portfolio Wealth Accelerator tool.** This is why IK is listed as a Gameplans customer.\n\n---\n\n## IK's Investment Strategy Framework\n\n### The Three-Phase Cycle\nFrom Amazon description of The Property Nerds podcast:\n> \"Acquire, Optimise, and Consolidate\"\n\n1. **Acquire** — find and buy the right property in the right market\n2. **Optimise** — manage it, renovate if needed, maximise yield and equity\n3. **Consolidate** — review portfolio, decide what to hold/sell, prepare for next acquisition\n\nThis is a *lifecycle framework* — not just buy and hold.\n\n### How They Select Markets\n- Macro: population growth, infrastructure, employment, supply/demand\n- Micro: suburb-level data, vacancy rates, rental demand, comparable sales\n- Avoiding herd mentality — often counter-cyclical\n- Currently active in 9–15 markets at once\n\n### Client Success Metrics IK Tracks\n- Capital growth vs national average\n- Rental yield performance\n- Equity position (usable equity for next purchase)\n- Passive income trajectory vs retirement goal\n- Time to financial independence\n\n---\n\n## Client Case Studies (Revealing the Journey)\n\n### Nafiz — 5 properties, $2.86M, $900k+ equity over 5 years\n- Started: 26-year-old young professional living at home\n- First buy: Brisbane house, 2019 — now up 95.94%\n- Built across QLD, SA, WA — diversified nationally\n- Matched each purchase to life stage and income growth\n\n### Daniel — 7 properties, $8.92M portfolio\n- Started: seasoned business owner, 2020\n- First buy: Brisbane $550k → now $1.02M (85.45% growth)\n- Now spans 4 states — blend of growth, yield, diversification\n- Treats IK \"like a key advisor in his business\"\n\n### Ryan & Lauren — 5 properties, $4.5M by age 30\n- Two physios in Darwin\n- Brisbane house (2020): $485k → ~$1M (106% growth)\n- Bundaberg (2022): $390k → $620k (59%)\n- Ballarat (earlier, DIY): slow performer — lesson in needing strategy\n- Portfolio plan shows: on track for $100k+ inflation-adjusted passive income in retirement\n- **Key quote:** \"They no longer feel like retirement is an open question. They know time is now working in their favour.\"\n\n### The \"3 properties within 3 years\" stat\n- IK's headline claim: \"most of our clients obtain 3 properties within 3 years\"\n- This pulls them into the top 10% of property investors in Australia\n\n---\n\n## InvestorKit's Tech Stack\n\n- Uses Gameplans (Portfolio Wealth Accelerator) for visual portfolio modelling\n- Proprietary data/research models (internal — not client-facing)\n- CRM for client lifecycle tracking\n- Remote-first operation — heavy reliance on video/digital tools\n\n---\n\n## InvestorKit vs PropPath — Gap Analysis\n\n| Feature | InvestorKit (Current) | PropPath (Opportunity) |\n|---------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Portfolio mapping session | ✅ Yes — human-delivered | ✅ Software-delivered |\n| Long-term projection/roadmap | ✅ Yes — shows retirement income | ✅ Visual, interactive, updatable |\n| Monthly client review | ✅ Yes — human-delivered by Portfolio Strategist | ✅ Automated dashboard replaces/augments |\n| Ongoing equity tracking | ⚠️ Manual (CRM notes) | ✅ Live, auto-updating |\n| Client-facing dashboard | ❌ No standalone portal | ✅ Core PropPath feature |\n| Scenario modelling (\"what if I buy X?\") | ⚠️ Done in sessions (Gameplans) | ✅ Client can self-serve |\n| Milestone notifications | ❌ None automated | ✅ \"You've hit equity threshold for next buy\" |\n| Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate tracking | ❌ Manual | ✅ Built into roadmap phases |\n| Commercial transition planning | ⚠️ Human-guided | ✅ Roadmap accommodates it |\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Insight: Why IK is the Perfect PropPath Customer\n\n1. **They already believe in portfolio planning** — it's their core product (Portfolio Mapping Session)\n2. **They use Gameplans** — so they understand the value of visual modelling tools\n3. **They have the monthly review problem** — a Portfolio Strategist manually does what PropPath automates\n4. **They're scaling fast** — $15M → $25M revenue means more clients, more portfolio reviews needed, more strain on human-delivered sessions\n5. **Their clients want ongoing tracking** — the Ryan & Lauren story shows clients want \"peace of mind\" and to know they're on track\n6. **IK positions on data** — PropPath's data-driven roadmap aligns perfectly with their brand\n\n**PropPath pitch to IK:**\n> \"You're doing portfolio mapping manually in sessions. We turn that into a living client dashboard. Your Portfolio Strategists spend less time on monthly reviews and more time on high-value strategy. Your clients get peace of mind between sessions.\"\n\n---\n\n## Key People\n\n| Name | Role |\n|------|------|\n| Arjun Paliwal | Founder & CEO, Head of Research |\n| Adrian (surname unknown) | Senior Portfolio Strategist |\n| AJ (surname unknown) | Team member (mentioned in reviews) |\n| Jack Fouracre | Co-host on Property Nerds podcast, Fouracre Financial |\n\n---\n\n## Content Ecosystem\n\n| Channel | Name | Format |\n|---------|------|--------|\n| Podcast | The Property Nerds | Weekly with Arjun + co-hosts |\n| Blog | investorkit.com.au/blog | Articles on strategy, rentvesting, markets |\n| Podcast | InvestorKit Podcast (separate) | Client stories, investor journeys |\n| Social | Instagram @arjpaliwal | 8.3k followers |\n| Social | Facebook @arjunfrominvestorkit | 9.2k likes |\n| Media | Forbes Australia Aug 2025 | Major feature |\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771918915414}}

Just IK as a business, a service, and a client experience.*\n*Research: Feb 2026*\n\n---\n\n## What InvestorKit Actually Is\n\nInvestorKit is a **national buyers agency** that specialises in investment property. Not a tool. Not an education platform. A team of humans who find, evaluate, and negotiate property purchases on behalf of clients building long-term portfolios.\n\nThey've layered onto that core service:\n- A proprietary research framework (data-first suburb selection)\n- A structured client lifecycle (Portfolio Strategist model)\n- A podcast content brand (The Property Nerds)\n- A visual portfolio modelling layer (Gameplans, branded as Portfolio Wealth Accelerator)\n\n---\n\n## Business Model\n\n- **Revenue:** ~$15M in 2024-25 (up from $7.6M prior year, $3.6M the year before — near doubling YoY)\n- **Forecast:** $23–25M in 2025-26\n- **Clients:** 1,200+ families served\n- **Staff:** 80+ full-time across InvestorKit Group\n- **Founded:** 2018 by Arjun Paliwal (ex-CBA, left at 26 with 9 properties)\n- **Recognition:** REB Buyers Agency of the Year — 2023 AND 2024 (only agency to win consecutively)\n- **Reviews:** 700+ five-star reviews\n- **Media:** Forbes Australia Aug 2025, 1000+ media articles total\n\n---\n\n## How They Make Money\n\nIK charges a **buyer's agent fee** per property purchase — typically a flat fee or % of purchase price. No public pricing on their site (leads must book a call). Based on industry norms, likely $8k–$15k per property for residential.\n\nTheir revenue doubling YoY suggests either:\n- More clients (volume), or\n- Expansion into higher-value commercial ($2M–$10M+) where fees scale accordingly\n- Likely both\n\nThe commercial tier is explicitly part of their offer — minimum $2M–$10M+ purchase price.\n\n---\n\n## The Team Structure (Private Banking Model)\n\nArjun deliberately modelled IK on how CBA's private banking team worked — one point of contact for each client, but the client accesses a team of specialists behind that contact.\n\n| Role | Function |\n|------|----------|\n| **Portfolio Strategist** | Client-facing relationship owner. Runs portfolio mapping sessions, monthly strategy reviews, buyer briefs, manages lifecycle |\n| **Research Team** | Suburb selection, market data, proprietary modelling. Identifies markets BEFORE the curve |\n| **Acquisitions Team** | Sourcing properties, negotiating, off-market deals (70% of deals are off-market) |\n| **Client Success / Onboarding** | Post-purchase support, annual reviews |\n\nThe **Portfolio Strategist** is the highest-leverage role — they own the client relationship start to finish, from initial strategy session through to repeat purchases.\n\n---\n\n## What Clients Actually Go Through\n\n### Entry Requirements\n- Minimum usable equity or funds: ~$100k\n- Minimum residential purchase: $525k\n- Minimum SMSF purchase: $575k\n- Minimum commercial: $2M–$10M+\n- Timeline from brief to purchase: **1–4 months** (depends on how specific client is with their brief)\n- SMSF purchases: Yes\n- Trust purchases: Yes\n\n### What They DON'T Buy (Hard Rules)\n- New builds\n- NDIS properties\n- Units / apartments\n- Knockdown rebuilds\n- Major renovation properties\n\nOnly 8% of properties reviewed pass IK's due diligence.\n\n### The Client Journey (Step by Step)\n\n**1. Portfolio Assessment**\nInitial session — understand the client's goals, financial position, investment experience, risk profile. This is where the Portfolio Strategist maps the current state vs target state.\n\n**2. Property Brief Creation**\nA written \"buyer brief\" — targets specific yield, capital growth, or cash flow balance. Validated with the client's broker for borrowing capacity. This is not a standard brief — it's tailored to the specific stage of the three-stage framework (see below).\n\n**3. Market Selection**\nResearch team identifies which of the 9–15 active markets fits the brief. Macro (population, infrastructure, employment) + micro (suburb vacancy, comparable sales, rental demand).\n\n**4. Property Sourcing**\nAcquisitions team works the market — 70% off-market. Rejects 92% reviewed. Negotiates.\n\n**5. Ongoing Support**\nPost-purchase check-ins. Annual review with Portfolio Strategist. Equity assessment. Prep for next purchase.\n\n**6. Post-Purchase Reviews**\nAnnual (confirmed in FAQ). Some clients get more frequent touchpoints during active growth phases.\n\n---\n\n## The Three-Stage Portfolio Framework\n\nIK uses explicit stage language with clients. Confirmed from Raj & Sowji case study and Michael case study.\n\n### Stage 1: Foundation\n- Blue chip capital city assets\n- Larger price points, major markets\n- Focus: capital growth, strong fundamentals\n- Purpose: build the equity base that funds the next stage\n\n### Stage 2: Momentum\n- Affordable entry points, spread nationally\n- Data-driven location selection — any city, not just capitals\n- Focus: use Foundation equity to acquire more at lower price points\n- Purpose: accelerate portfolio size and diversification\n\n### Stage 3: Passive\n- Commercial properties and unit blocks\n- Cash-flow positive from day one\n- Key insight: *\"Assets where you don't take one step back, two steps forward like in residential. You simply take a step forward as cash flow is present from day one and growth continues to accumulate.\"*\n- Purpose: transition from growth to income — financial independence\n\n### The Overarching Cycle: Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate\nFrom The Property Nerds podcast (Arjun, June 2024):\n- **Acquire** — find and buy the right property in the right market (at the right stage)\n- **Optimise** — manage, refinance, maximise equity and yield between purchases\n- **Consolidate** — review portfolio, decide what to hold/sell, prepare for next acquisition or stage transition\n\nThis is the macro lifecycle. The three stages (Foundation → Momentum → Passive) are WHERE you are. Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate is WHAT you do at each stage, repeatedly.\n\n---\n\n## Client Case Studies\n\n### Michael — 13 properties, $16.54M, $2.8M equity in 5 years\n- Spanned 5 states\n- Clear arc: foundational residential → momentum regional → commercial transition\n- The furthest along any publicly showcased IK client\n\n### Raj & Sowji — 8 properties, $9M+, 4 states\n- Went through Foundation → Momentum explicitly\n- Now transitioning to Passive (commercial/unit blocks)\n- The case study that confirmed IK's three-stage language\n\n### Ryan & Lauren — 5 properties, $4.5M by age 30\n- Two physios in Darwin\n- Brisbane 2020: $485k → ~$1M (106% growth)\n- Bundaberg 2022: $390k → $620k (59%)\n- Portfolio plan shows: on track for $100k+ inflation-adjusted passive income in retirement\n- Quote: *\"They no longer feel like retirement is an open question. They know time is now working in their favour.\"*\n\n### Nafiz — 5 properties, $2.86M, $900k+ equity over 5 years\n- Started at 26, living at home\n- Brisbane 2019: up 95.94%\n- Built across QLD, SA, WA\n- Matched each purchase to life stage and income growth\n\n### Daniel — 7 properties, $8.92M portfolio\n- Business owner, started 2020\n- Brisbane $550k → $1.02M (85.45%)\n- Spans 4 states\n- Treats IK \"like a key advisor in his business\"\n\n### The Headline Stat\n> \"Most of our clients obtain 3 properties within 3 years\" — puts clients in top 10% of property investors in Australia.\n\n---\n\n## The Portfolio Mapping Session — IK's Core Product\n\nThis is what IK ACTUALLY SELLS. Not just properties. A forward-looking portfolio plan.\n\n### What happens:\n1. Understand financial goals, investment experience, risk profile\n2. Build a tailored brief — targets yield, capital growth, or cash flow balance\n3. Generate a portfolio plan — forward-looking roadmap showing long-term impact\n4. Collaborate with broker to validate borrowing capacity\n5. Produce a buyer brief that drives acquisition\n\n### What the Portfolio Plan projects:\n- Portfolio value trajectory\n- Passive income at target date (e.g. retirement)\n- Inflation-adjusted projections\n- Multi-property, multi-state view\n\nThis is where Gameplans (their visual modelling tool, branded as \"Portfolio Wealth Accelerator\") is used. The PWA was a campaign/content wrapper for Gameplans-powered sessions — NOT a standalone software product (page now redirects to homepage).\n\n### Ongoing rhythm:\n- Annual reviews (confirmed in FAQ as baseline)\n- Monthly client review sessions (mentioned in Portfolio Strategist job description — may apply to active/high-velocity clients)\n- Portfolio Strategist identifies upsell opportunities between purchases\n\n---\n\n## Content & Brand Ecosystem\n\n### The Property Nerds Podcast\n- Hosts: Arjun Paliwal (IK Founder), Adrian Lee (Senior Portfolio Strategist, IK), Jack Fouracre (Fouracre Financial)\n- Published on: Smart Property Investment network AND standalone feed\n- Original co-host: Kent Lardner (Suburbtrends) — inception 2021\n- Topics: market data, client stories, strategy deep dives, portfolio frameworks\n- Recent: Nafiz client story (June 2025)\n\n### InvestorKit Podcast (separate)\n- Client stories, investor journeys\n- More case-study focused\n\n### Blog / Media\n- investorkit.com.au/blog — strategy articles, market commentary\n- 1000+ media appearances\n- Forbes Australia (Aug 2025) major feature\n\n### Social\n- Instagram: @arjpaliwal — 8.3k followers\n- Facebook: @arjunfrominvestorkit — 9.2k likes\n\n---\n\n## Key People\n\n| Name | Role |\n|------|------|\n| Arjun Paliwal | Founder & CEO, Head of Research. Ex-CBA. Had 9 properties at 26. |\n| Adrian Lee | Senior Portfolio Strategist. Co-host of Property Nerds. |\n| Jack Fouracre | External — co-host on Property Nerds, runs Fouracre Financial (mortgage broking) |\n| Kent Lardner | Original Property Nerds co-host, Suburbtrends (data) — appears to have stepped back |\n\n---\n\n## Research Methodology (What Makes IK's Selection Different)\n\n- Buying in 9–15 markets at any given time (national, not local)\n- 20-point due diligence checklist per property\n- Rejects 92% of properties reviewed\n- 70% of deals sourced off-market\n- Has outperformed national property market by 49%+ every year since inception\n- Counter-cyclical — often buying against herd mentality\n- Macro signals: population growth, infrastructure, employment, supply/demand\n- Micro signals: vacancy rates, rental demand, comparable sales, suburb trajectory\n\n---\n\n## What IK Clients Experience Emotionally\n\nFrom case studies and podcast content, the recurring emotional arc:\n\n1. **Confusion/Overwhelm** — too many suburbs, too much conflicting advice, don't know where to start\n2. **First purchase relief** — \"I've finally done it, I'm on the board\"\n3. **Impatience** — waiting for equity to build, wanting to buy again\n4. **Milestone clarity** — \"I can see the plan now, I know what next looks like\"\n5. **Confidence** — repeat purchases feel easier, trust in the process\n6. **Peace of mind** — knowing they're on track for retirement, not just hoping\n\nThe Ryan & Lauren quote captures the IK end-state promise perfectly:\n> *\"They no longer feel like retirement is an open question. They know time is now working in their favour.\"*\n\n---\n\n## IK's Competitive Moat\n\n1. **Data infrastructure** — proprietary research, 49%+ outperformance, hard to replicate\n2. **Private banking model** — Portfolio Strategist = trusted advisor, not a transactional agent\n3. **Awards** — REB BA of Year 2x running creates credibility in a trust-based market\n4. **Content flywheel** — Property Nerds podcast creates warm leads, educates prospects, builds authority\n5. **Annual reviews** — ongoing client relationship = repeat purchases, referrals, LTV\n6. **National reach** — 9–15 markets active simultaneously, not limited by local knowledge\n"}}],"api":"openai-completions","provider":"openrouter","model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6","usage":{"input":2151,"output":3203,"cacheRead":32748,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":38102,"cost":{"input":0.006453,"output":0.048045000000000004,"cacheRead":0.009824399999999999,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0.0643224}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771919582483}}
