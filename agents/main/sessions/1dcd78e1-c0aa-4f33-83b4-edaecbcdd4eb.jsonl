Drop the BADirectory tab - not interested in lead gen yet\n2. The session is at 50k credits (should have stopped at 20k) - how to fix this\n\nLet me address both. For the session limit, I need to think about how to enforce this. The AGENTS.md says \"When session reaches 20,000 tokens, STOP what you're doing and say: 'Session at 20k tokens. Starting fresh to save costs. Key context saved to memory/.'\" \n\nThe issue is I can't automatically monitor my own token usage during a session - I'd need to check it periodically. Options:\n\n\n1. I could check session_status periodically during long work sessions\n2. I could save state to a HANDOFF.md file each research cycle so a fresh session can pick up where I left off\n3. Rob could set up a cron/heartbeat that pings me to check token usage\n\nThe most practical approach is to create a RESEARCH_STATE.md that gets updated after each research block, capturing exactly where I am and what to do next. That way any new session can pick up seamlessly, and I can flag when I'm getting close to the limit.\n\nFor the sheet structure, I'm planning 4 tabs: CompetitorIntel, MarketIntel, ResearchLog, and KeyInsights. But I realize I shouldn't start building the sheets in this session since I'm already at 50k tokens. I should focus on answering Rob's questions first, then save a handoff document before wrapping up.","thinkingSignature":"reasoning"},{"type":"text","text":"Fair on both points. Let me address them directly.\n\n**On BADirectory** — dropped. We'll add it when you're ready to do outreach.\n\n**On the 50k token problem** — this is on me. I got absorbed in the research and didn't check. Here's how we fix it structurally:\n\nThe real issue is I have no automatic self-monitor. So the solution is twofold:\n\n1. **I save a `HANDOFF.md` after every research block** — a complete \"pickup file\" so any fresh session knows exactly where I am, what I found, and what to do next. No context lost when we reset.\n\n2. **I check `session_status` every 3 research cycles** and flag if I'm approaching 20k. I'll make this a hard habit, not optional.\n\nRight now this session is too far gone to keep working efficiently. Let me save the handoff file now, then you start a fresh session and it picks up autonomously."},{"type":"toolCall","id":"toolu_vrtx_019CWepyaNtZCfYjatRBGoZZ","name":"write","arguments":{"path":"/Users/robertknowles/.openclaw/workspace/memory/knowledge/HANDOFF.md","content":"# Research Handoff — Industry Intelligence Deep Dive\n*Written: 2026-02-22 | Pick up from here in next session*\n\n## Mission\nBecome the world's leading expert on the Australian property investment / buyers' agent industry to guide PropPath's product, positioning, and customer acquisition.\n\n## What's Been Done (Session 1)\n\n### Files written to memory/knowledge/\n- `investment_fundamentals.md` — Core strategies, due diligence, investor journey model, \"secret sauce\" of elite BAs\n- `competitor_software.md` — Gameplans (CRITICAL direct competitor), InvestorKit, Dashdot, spreadsheet status quo\n- `market_community_pulse.md` — Reddit/community sentiment, BA pain points, market terminology, hot markets\n\n### Key Findings So Far\n1. **Gameplans is the direct competitor** — 400+ BA firms, 4.8 stars Trustpilot, PIPA partner, 6 years old. B2B SaaS sold to BAs. They have white-label model, 30yr projections, equity notifications.\n2. **Spreadsheets are the status quo** — every BA uses them. The real competitor is inertia.\n3. **BAs want to look like heroes** — tools that make them look smart to clients = high willingness to pay\n4. **\"Covers itself with first client\"** — the right pricing frame. Gameplans BAs charge $2-5k per strategy session.\n5. **Full lifecycle gap** — Gameplans does strategy/forecasting. Acquisition workflow + portfolio management is still fragmented.\n\n## Google Sheet — NOT YET BUILT\n### Planned structure (4 tabs, confirmed with Rob):\n1. **CompetitorIntel** — Companies/tools. Columns: Company | Website | Target Audience | Positioning | Key Features | Pricing | Strengths | Weaknesses/Gaps | PropPath Opportunity | Threat Level | Source | Last Updated\n2. **MarketIntel** — Forum/community findings. Columns: Source | Platform | Topic/Theme | Key Insight | Sentiment | Who Said It | Relevance to PropPath | URL | Date Found\n3. **ResearchLog** — Tracks Bertie's work.

Fee structure? (Search: \"buyers agent fee structure australia 2025 how much do they charge\")\n2. **Gameplans pricing** — exact subscription tiers (try their pricing page or Trustpilot reviews mentioning cost)\n3. **REBAA / PIPA** — regulatory body for BAs. How many licensed? What are membership requirements?\n4. **BA tech stack** — what tools do BAs use day-to-day beyond data platforms? (CRM, comms, reporting)\n5. **YouTube content** — search \"buyers agent property investment strategy australia\" on YouTube for video transcripts/themes\n6. **More community** — hit Whirlpool forums, PropertyChat (need different approach — search via Google: site:propertychat.com.au \"buyers agent\" \"software\" OR \"spreadsheet\")\n\n## Session Rules (Self-Enforcement)\n- Check session_status every 3 research cycles\n- If over 15k tokens: finish current block, write to knowledge files, update HANDOFF.md, tell Rob\n- NEVER go past 20k without flagging\n\n## Continuation Instruction\nNext session: Read this HANDOFF.md first. Then:\n1. Build the 4 Google Sheet tabs\n2. Populate CompetitorIntel with Gameplans, InvestorKit, Dashdot data already in competitor_software.md\n3. Populate MarketIntel with findings from market_community_pulse.md\n4. Continue research from gap list above\n5.
