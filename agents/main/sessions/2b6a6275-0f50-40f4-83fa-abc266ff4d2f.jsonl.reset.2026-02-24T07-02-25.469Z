No trade, high school dropout, farm background.\n- **Education arm:** Sammy Gordon's School of Property (schoolofproperty.com.au)\n- **Podcast:** Scouting Australia Podcast (highly active, 2023–2026)\n\nAPS is considered **best-in-class** for investment-focused buyers' agency + education in Australia. Their approach is strategy-first, education-first — before they buy anything for a client, they educate them on why.\n\n---\n\n## Core Philosophy & Mental Models\n\n### 1. Reverse-Engineering Goals\n- Start with the end income goal (e.g. $100k passive income/year)\n- Reverse engineer: how many properties at what yield get you there?\n  - Example: 4 properties × $25k yield each = $100k/yr\n- Then work backwards: what's your timeframe? What's your current borrowing capacity? How fast can you accumulate?\n\n### 2. \"Acting Rich vs Being Wealthy\"\n- Short-term sacrifice = long-term freedom\n- Sam's mantra: \"A few years of sacrifice can set you up for a lifetime of financial freedom\"\n- Classic mistake: leasing expensive cars, luxury spending → kills borrowing capacity\n- Client story: sold a depreciating ute, bought 3 properties in 12 months, $500k equity in one year\n- Sam himself: drove an old Land Rover, spent holidays doing renovations for 7 years\n\n### 3. Property as a Business\n- Treat investing as a business, not a hobby\n- Maintain low LVRs (loan-to-value ratios) to sustain portfolio expansion\n- Leverage equity intelligently — don't just wait, manufacture it where possible\n\n### 4. \"You Can't Pay Rent With Fish\"\n- Repeated phrase: take action, don't overthink\n- 92% of Australians never own more than 1–2 investment properties\n- Mindset + network + community are the differentiators\n\n### 5. \"You Can Never Out-Save a Good Market\"\n- Capital growth outpaces savings rates\n- Getting into the market and in the right market matters more than timing perfectly\n- Get in, leverage growth, recycle into next purchase\n\n---\n\n## The Three Deal Types (APS Framework)\n\nAPS categorises deals into three types — this is the core of their strategy framework:\n\n### Type 1: Bread & Butter (B&B) Deals\n- **Core concept:** Solid growth asset in a proven location, bought below market value\n- Formula: **Solid Growth Location + Below Market Value Purchase**\n- These are the backbone of portfolio building — reliable, scalable\n- Not flashy, not high yield — but steady capital growth + manufactured equity on entry\n- APS team uses networks/off-market connections to find these\n- Key metric: can you buy it at a discount? How much equity do you manufacture on purchase?\n- Sam's quote: \"Some buyers' agents claim buying below market value is a myth. It's not. It just requires experience and connections.\"\n\n### Type 2: Manufactured Cash Flow Deals\n- Higher yield properties in regional/growth markets\n- Goal: positive or neutral cash flow to improve serviceability for next purchase\n- Often involves: granny flats, dual income properties, commercial residential hybrids\n- Solving the serviceability problem: each cash flow deal makes it easier to borrow again\n- These are what allow you to buy 3 properties off one deposit — cash flow from property 1 & 2 supports serviceability for property 3\n\n### Type 3: Manufactured Equity (via Renovation/Construction)\n- Buy underperforming property, add value through strategic renovation\n- Unlock equity quickly to fund next purchase without saving a new deposit\n- APS has an in-house renovations/construction project management team\n- Key: don't over-capitalise — renovate for value, not for taste\n\n---\n\n## The \"3 Properties Off 1 Deposit\" Scenario\n\nThis is APS's signature repeatable outcome — and a powerful concept for PropPath:\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Save one deposit (say $50–80k)\n2. Buy Property 1 — ideally B&B deal with some below-market equity, moderate to good yield\n3. Property 1's rental income + any manufactured equity (reno or instant below-market) = **improved serviceability + usable equity**\n4. Use equity from Property 1 to fund deposit for Property 2 (cross-collateralise or equity release via broker)\n5. Property 2 = cash flow focused → further improves serviceability\n6. Now serviceable enough for Property 3 — can be a growth asset\n7. Result: 3 properties in 12 months, from one initial deposit\n\n**Real client example (Liam, $65k income):**\n- Started: $55k deposit, $65k income\n- Result: 3 properties in 2.5 years\n- Total portfolio cost: $695,000\n- Total portfolio value: $1,120,000\n- Net equity: $425,000\n- Overall yield: 7.9%\n\n**Real client example (Luke):**\n- 4 properties in <2 years, across 3 states\n- Portfolio cost: $1,140,000\n- Portfolio value: $1,680,000\n- Net equity: $540,000\n- Yield: 7.7%\n\n**Real client example (Tim & Katie):**\n- First deal: $410k purchase\n- Market value immediately: $450k+\n- Instant equity: $40k+\n- Rental return: $510/week (6.5% yield)\n\n**Real client example (Ella):**\n- First property at 21, 5-property portfolio by 24\n\n**Real client example (Nathan & Katelyn, 2025):**\n- 5 properties in 12 months\n- Portfolio worth $2.5 million\n\n---\n\n## Key Strategic Concepts\n\n### Serviceability Management\n- **The core challenge:** Banks don't just look at deposits — they look at income vs total debt obligations\n- As portfolio grows, serviceability gets tighter (each new mortgage adds to assessed liabilities)\n- APS solution: **interleave cash flow deals with growth deals** — the cash flow deals offset the serviceability drag\n- Working with specialist investment brokers is essential (not just any bank)\n- \"Dealing with lenders stalling his journey, serviceability caps\" — this is a real obstacle APS clients navigate\n- Low LVR discipline helps maintain borrowing capacity over time\n\n### Market Selection for Growth\n- APS invests across multiple states (not just local market)\n- Look for: supply/demand imbalance, infrastructure spending, population growth, job creation\n- Don't just buy in your backyard (Sydney, Melbourne = often too expensive to get yield)\n- Understanding data: median prices, vacancy rates, days on market, auction clearance rates\n- Episode: \"How To Pick A Growth Market & Understanding Data\"\n\n### Geographic Diversification\n- Spread across 3+ states = reduces concentration risk\n- Different market cycles → one state growing while another flat\n- Episode chapter: \"Diversification: When to Buy Across States?\"\n\n### Buying Below Market Value\n- APS's differentiator — off-market connections, strong negotiation\n- Manufactured equity on day 1 = instant safety margin\n- Not a myth — requires networks and experience\n- Chapter: \"Buying Below Market Value: What Does It Mean?\"\n\n### Sell vs Hold\n- General APS philosophy: **hold long-term** — \"you can never out-save a good market\"\n- Only sell if: property fundamentally underperforming AND capital could be better deployed\n- Selling triggers CGT — usually a last resort\n- Episode: \"Sell vs Hold: Decision Making When a Property Is Stagnant\"\n\n### Underperforming Assets — Assessment\n- Regular portfolio review: is each property pulling its weight?\n- Assess: capital growth (what has it done?), cash flow (is it neutral/positive?), location outlook (still strong?)\n- Episode: \"Assessing Underperforming Properties\"\n\n### SMSF Investing\n- APS clients increasingly using SMSF for property\n- Covered in Q&A episode: \"SMSF Strategies\"\n- Adds complexity but tax benefits at retirement phase\n\n### Depreciation\n- Episode chapter: \"Depreciation: Should You Target Newer Builds?\"\n- Newer builds have higher depreciation schedules → better tax offset\n- Trade-off: new builds often have less manufacturing opportunity (already priced at market)\n\n### Blue Collar vs Blue Chip\n- Episode: \"Blue Collar vs Blue Chip: Personal Residence Strategy\"\n- APS clients often start with investment-grade properties before premium personal residence\n- Blue collar = reliable yield, affordable, often regional\n- Blue chip = high capital growth, low yield, expensive entry\n\n### Mindset Scaling: 1–2 Properties to 5–10\n- The shift from \"accidental landlord\" to \"strategic investor\"\n- Episode: \"Mindset Shifts: Scaling from 1–2 to 5–10 Properties\"\n- Requires: portfolio plan, broker relationship, accountant structure, trust in process\n\n---\n\n## Is Cash Flow Dead? (Major Debate)\n\nAPS devoted a full episode to this. Key takeaways:\n- In 2023–2025, rising interest rates squeezed cash flow significantly\n- High-yield deals harder to find in capital cities → must look regionally\n- But: **cash flow is not dead** — it has moved, not disappeared\n- Regional QLD, SA, WA, parts of NT: still positive cash flow deals available\n- APS position: cash flow + growth balance is the goal, not pure cash flow chasing\n- \"You can't just chase yield without growth — you get stuck\"\n- \"Bread and butter\" is now the safer path for most; cash flow is the unlock for serviceability\n\n---\n\n## APS Content Ecosystem (Sources for Ongoing Research)\n\n| Source | Type | Key Topics |\n|--------|------|-----------|\n| Scouting Australia Podcast | Weekly podcast | Case studies, Q&A, strategy deep-dives |\n| School of Property (schoolofproperty.com.au) | Paid education | Full curriculum for beginners + advanced |\n| APS YouTube (Sam Gordon) | Video | Strategy explainers, case studies |\n| APS website /media | Podcast archive | All episodes listed |\n| TikTok @australianpropertyscout | Short-form | Market tips, quick insights |\n| Facebook | Video | Deal type explainers (B&B video) |\n\n---\n\n## PropPath Relevance — What APS Tells Us\n\n### What APS clients need (and what PropPath could visualise):\n1. **The portfolio roadmap** — reverse engineered from income goal → number of properties → timeline\n2. **Deal type sequencing** — B&B first, then cash flow, then growth → which order for YOUR situation?\n3. **Serviceability tracking** — after each purchase, what's my remaining borrowing capacity?\n4. **Equity position over time** — live tracking of manufactured + organic equity\n5. **Milestone events** — \"you now have enough equity to buy Property 2\" (like Gameplans equity trigger alerts)\n6. **State diversification map** — visualise spread across states\n7. **Cash flow vs growth balance** — at a portfolio level, not just per property\n8. **Goal progress** — am I on track to hit $100k passive income by 2030?\n\n### What APS's process lacks (PropPath opportunity):\n- No client-facing ongoing dashboard — sessions are point-in-time\n- No living portfolio roadmap between sessions\n- No automated equity trigger notifications\n- No visualisation of \"what if I add property X — how does it change my position?\"\n\n---\n\n## Key Quotes (Use in PropPath Positioning)\n\n- \"92% of Australians never own more than 1–2 investment properties\" — the ceiling PropPath helps break through\n- \"A few years of sacrifice can set you up for a lifetime of financial freedom\"\n- \"Your network is your net worth\"\n- \"You can never out-save a good market\"\n- \"Education first — before we source a property, we educate you on why we're buying there\"\n- \"Acting rich vs being wealthy\"\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771745525513}}

Everything below is sourced directly.\n\n### What It Is (from job listing for Portfolio Strategist role):\n> \"Conduct high-quality portfolio mapping sessions tailored to each client's goals and investment profile.\"\n> \"Collaborate with brokers and acquisitions teams to generate accurate, actionable buyer briefs.\"\n> \"Provide timely and ongoing strategic guidance to existing clients to support repeat purchases.\"\n> \"Lead monthly client review sessions and maintain engagement throughout the lifecycle.\"\n\n### What Happens In It:\n- Deep dive into current financial position (income, savings, existing properties, borrowing capacity)\n- Goal-setting: passive income target, timeline, risk tolerance\n- Build a tailored **portfolio plan** — a long-term roadmap showing path to goal\n- Plan shows: which properties to buy, in what sequence, and projected long-term income\n- Used as reference during ongoing engagement and repeat purchases\n\n### From the $4.5M Case Study (Ryan & Lauren):\n> \"Using their portfolio plan with InvestorKit, they can see the long term impact. The properties alone are on track to support an inflation adjusted passive income target above $100,000 per year in retirement, before including super.\"\n\nThis is the **living portfolio plan** — it spans the full journey, not just one purchase.\n\n### Portfolio Wealth Accelerator\n- A tool/product InvestorKit built (or licences — likely Gameplans)\n- Quote: \"This mapping technology enables me to continuously monitor the performance of my portfolio and make informed decisions based on valuable insights.\"\n- Quote: \"Clients of InvestorKit have also benefited from utilising this tool during their journey with our Buyer's Agents to enhance their investment strategies.\"\n- **This is their internal tool** — used by BAs with clients, not a client-facing portal\n- Strongly suggested this IS Gameplans (InvestorKit is listed as a Gameplans client in prior research)\n\n---\n\n## InvestorKit's Core Investment Framework\n\n### The Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate Cycle\nFrom The Property Nerds podcast:\n1. **Acquire** — find and purchase next property in sequence\n2. **Optimise** — maximise performance of existing portfolio (refinancing, property management, rent reviews)\n3. **Consolidate** — review position, assess borrowing capacity, prepare for next cycle\n\nThis is the **strategic cycle** that repeats. PropPath should visualise this.\n\n### Four Criteria for a Good Investment:\n1. **Right Property for You** — matches risk tolerance, strategy, goals\n2. **In the Right Market** — growth cycle or about to enter one (data-driven market selection)\n3. **At the Right Price** — due diligence on comparables, yield, risk\n4. **Passes All Due Diligence** — legal, rental demand, building, red flags\n\n### Portfolio Strategy Approach:\n- Long-term hold bias — \"let the market do the heavy lifting\"\n- Multi-state diversification (standard for IK clients: 3+ states)\n- Mix of high-growth and yield assets\n- Annual reviews built into client engagement\n- Residential AND commercial property (they do both)\n- 20-point due diligence checklist on every deal\n\n---\n\n## Client Case Studies (PropPath Relevant Examples)\n\n### Nafiz (26yo, young professional):\n- 2019: 1st property, Brisbane (data-driven, not local)\n- 5 years later: 5-property portfolio, $2.86M value, $900K+ equity\n- Diversified: QLD, SA, WA\n- \"Matched each purchase to his life stage and income growth\"\n\n### Daniel (business owner):\n- 2020: Brisbane house, $550K → now $1.02M (85% growth)\n- Now: 7-property portfolio, $8.92M across 4 states\n- \"Blend of high-growth, yield, and diversification\"\n\n### Ryan & Lauren (2 physios, Darwin):\n- $4.5M portfolio across 5 properties, 3 states, by age 30\n- Brisbane: $485K → ~$1M (106% growth, 5 years, sight unseen)\n- Bundaberg: $390K → ~$620K (59% growth)\n- Ballarat: slower performer, lesson in patience and process\n- Portfolio plan shows: on track to $100K+ passive income/year at retirement\n- Money habits: all income in offset, credit card for monthly spend, cleared in full\n\n---\n\n## APS vs InvestorKit — Key Differences for PropPath\n\n| Dimension | APS (Sam Gordon) | InvestorKit (Arjun Paliwal) |\n|-----------|-----------------|------------------------------|\n| Style | Energetic, community-driven, \"shark\" branding | Data-nerd, analytical, institutional feel |\n| Revenue | Not disclosed | $15M FY25, growing ~100% YoY |\n| Staff | Smaller, tight-knit | 80+ FT staff |\n| Tool | Gameplans (confirmed) | Portfolio Wealth Accelerator (likely Gameplans) |\n| Education | School of Property (paid course) | The Property Nerds podcast, blog |\n| Entry | Any income level, sacrifice mindset | More professional/executive clients |\n| Portfolio plan | Session-based (Gameplans) | \"Living\" portfolio plan with ongoing reviews |\n| Post-settlement | Support & reinvest stage | Monthly reviews, annual check-ins |\n\n---\n\n## Critical Insight for PropPath\n\nInvestorKit explicitly promises a **\"portfolio plan\"** that clients can reference throughout their journey — showing long-term income projections, property sequencing, and retirement outcomes. BUT:\n\n1. This plan is **BA-controlled** — the strategist holds it, presents it in sessions\n2. Clients reference it **through conversations with their BA**, not a client-facing tool\n3. The \"Portfolio Wealth Accelerator\" / Gameplans tool is **BA-facing only**\n4. There is **no client portal** where the investor can log in and see their roadmap\n\n**PropPath fills this gap:** The client gets their own living roadmap. They can see it anytime. It updates as properties are added. It shows them their progress toward their $100K passive income goal. The BA uses it WITH the client — not just for the BA.\n\n---\n\n## InvestorKit Portfolio Strategist Role (What They Do Day-to-Day)\nThis tells us exactly what PropPath needs to support:\n- Portfolio mapping sessions (initial strategy)\n- Buyer briefs (what to buy next, aligned to plan)\n- CRM tracking (notes, stages, milestones)\n- Monthly client review sessions\n- Upsell identification (when client is ready to buy again)\n- Managing clients through property rejections (confidence maintenance)\n- Ongoing strategic guidance between purchases\n\n**Every one of these is a PropPath feature opportunity.**\n\n---\n\n## PropPath Positioning vs InvestorKit\n\nInvestorKit sells the BA service. PropPath is the tool that makes the BA look more professional, retain clients longer, and scale more sessions. InvestorKit would be a **target customer** for PropPath, not a competitor.\n\nTheir Portfolio Mapping Session = PropPath's portfolio roadmap builder.\nTheir monthly reviews = PropPath's ongoing dashboard.\nTheir buyer briefs = PropPath's \"next purchase\" recommendation module.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771745525522}}

This will be a quick 15-minute phone chat—so you can speak with us from wherever you’re comfortable without the need to join a video meeting.\\nDuring the call, we’ll have a relaxed conversation to understand where you’re at, what you’re looking to achieve, and whether we might be able to help. If it seems like a good fit, we’ll schedule a more in-depth video chat to dive deeper into your goals and walk you through our process. No pressure—just a friendly conversation to see if we can help you move forward with your property goals!\\n\\nYou’ll be chatting with one of our property consultants. They talk to investors every day and can help guide you on the best next steps. Feel free to ask them about their journey with InvestorKit too!\\n\\nYou don’t need pre-approval to get started, many investors kick things off without one, as long as their broker has given them the green light. Keep in mind, pre-approvals are time-limited and aren’t set in stone until you’re formally approved with a specific property that the bank is happy to lend against. If you’ve got a strong borrowing capacity, you can sort out pre-approval while going through our process.\\n\\nWe buy properties right across Australia. At any given time, we’re actively purchasing in 9 to 15 different areas or markets.\\n\\nWe don’t buy new build properties due to a few key reasons:\\n• Lack of reliable data on new build areas\\n• High supply can limit growth potential\\n• Too much of the cost is tied up in the liability (the house itself) rather than the land\\n• Potential delays in construction\\n• We prefer properties that are ready for tenants to move into immediately\\n\\nWhat sets InvestorKit apart is our unique combination of delivering high-performing properties, building a dedicated property team around you, and providing an exceptional client experience.\\nOur inhouse research team identifies markets ahead of the curve, ensuring your investments achieve superior performance. We complement this with a team of specialists; from strategists to acquisition experts, who guide you through every step of your investment journey.\\nThis is all underpinned by our commitment to outstanding client service, including regular check-ins, annual reviews, and ongoing support long after your purchase is complete.\\n\\nWe ensure a property is a good investment by focusing on four key elements:\\n\\n- The Right Property for You: We start by understanding your risk tolerance, and overall strategy to ensure the property aligns with what you want to achieve. It’s about finding the right fit for you.\\n- In the Right Market: Our in-house research team analyses extensive macro data to identify markets with strong growth potential. We focus on areas that are either in a growth cycle or about to enter one, ensuring that the market does the heavy lifting for you.\\n- At the Right Price: Through detailed due diligence, we assess rental yields, comparable sales, and potential risks to make sure the property is purchased at a price that maximises your return and minimises your risk.\\n- Passing All Due Diligence: Every property undergoes a comprehensive due diligence process to minimise risk and maximise returns. This includes legal checks, rental demand assessments, and a detailed review of any potential red flags.\\nThis layered approach guarantees that every investment is well-suited to your goals, strategically located, acquired at the best possible value, and passes all due diligence to safeguard your investment.\\n\\nOur service is comprehensive and covers everything you need for a successful investment journey. This includes…\\nPortfolio Assessment – Assessing your current portfolio to identify your position and potential opportunities. If you’re yet to start building a portfolio, we’ll guide you on what’s needed to achieve your investment goals.\\nProperty Brief Creation – Developing a tailored brief for your next property based on your current situation and objectives.\\nMarket Selection – Access to all our data to identify markets with strong growth potential.\\nProperty Sourcing – Finding and negotiating the right properties that fit your brief.\\nOngoing Support – Guiding you through the entire process right up until your property is tenanted.\\nPost-Purchase Reviews – Regular check-ins with yearly reviews to ensure you’re on track to meet your investment goals.\\nWe’re with you every step of the way!\\n\\nYou can invest in either residential or commercial properties. For commercial, you’ll need a higher deposit and borrowing capacity, so many investors start with residential first.\\nFor both types of properties, we focus on low-risk assets that require minimal work from you. On the residential side, we target markets that are either in a growth cycle or entering one, letting the market do the heavy lifting.\\nFor commercial properties, we look for assets with long leases that offer strong protection against potential vacancies.\\n\\nWe don’t invest in NDIS properties, new builds, units or apartments, knock-down rebuilds, or properties that need major work. Our focus is on established houses in growth markets that require minimal effort from you and offer strong potential for capital growth.\\n\\nNo, we don’t. Owner-occupier purchases are all about finding a home you’d love to live in, while our focus is purely on investment properties where the numbers stack up and the strategy aligns with your financial goals.\\n\\nIt usually takes between 1 to 4 months to secure a property, depending on the brief.

If you decide a property isn’t right for you, we’ll move on to the next one. However, we’ll also ask a few questions to understand why, so we can update your brief and make sure the next option is a better fit.\\n\\nWe track and review your portfolio through yearly reviews with your strategist.

This helps ensure your investments remain on the right track.\\n\\nGreat question—it really depends. If you have guarantor support, you might even be able to borrow the initial costs of buying. As a general rule of thumb though, you’ll need around $100k in equity or funds to get started. Our minimum purchase price for a residential property is $525k and above, or $575k+ for SMSF purchases. For commercial property typical budgets start from $2m, and can go up to $10m+ depending on your goals.\\n\\nAbsolutely. Many of our clients invest using an SMSF or Trust.

This will be a quick 15-minute phone chat—so you can speak with us from wherever you’re comfortable without the need to join a video meeting.\nDuring the call, we’ll have a relaxed conversation to understand where you’re at, what you’re looking to achieve, and whether we might be able to help. If it seems like a good fit, we’ll schedule a more in-depth video chat to dive deeper into your goals and walk you through our process. No pressure—just a friendly conversation to see if we can help you move forward with your property goals!\n\nYou’ll be chatting with one of our property consultants. They talk to investors every day and can help guide you on the best next steps. Feel free to ask them about their journey with InvestorKit too!\n\nYou don’t need pre-approval to get started, many investors kick things off without one, as long as their broker has given them the green light. Keep in mind, pre-approvals are time-limited and aren’t set in stone until you’re formally approved with a specific property that the bank is happy to lend against. If you’ve got a strong borrowing capacity, you can sort out pre-approval while going through our process.\n\nWe buy properties right across Australia. At any given time, we’re actively purchasing in 9 to 15 different areas or markets.\n\nWe don’t buy new build properties due to a few key reasons:\n• Lack of reliable data on new build areas\n• High supply can limit growth potential\n• Too much of the cost is tied up in the liability (the house itself) rather than the land\n• Potential delays in construction\n• We prefer properties that are ready for tenants to move into immediately\n\nWhat sets InvestorKit apart is our unique combination of delivering high-performing properties, building a dedicated property team around you, and providing an exceptional client experience.\nOur inhouse research team identifies markets ahead of the curve, ensuring your investments achieve superior performance. We complement this with a team of specialists; from strategists to acquisition experts, who guide you through every step of your investment journey.\nThis is all underpinned by our commitment to outstanding client service, including regular check-ins, annual reviews, and ongoing support long after your purchase is complete.\n\nWe ensure a property is a good investment by focusing on four key elements:\n\n- The Right Property for You: We start by understanding your risk tolerance, and overall strategy to ensure the property aligns with what you want to achieve. It’s about finding the right fit for you.\n- In the Right Market: Our in-house research team analyses extensive macro data to identify markets with strong growth potential. We focus on areas that are either in a growth cycle or about to enter one, ensuring that the market does the heavy lifting for you.\n- At the Right Price: Through detailed due diligence, we assess rental yields, comparable sales, and potential risks to make sure the property is purchased at a price that maximises your return and minimises your risk.\n- Passing All Due Diligence: Every property undergoes a comprehensive due diligence process to minimise risk and maximise returns. This includes legal checks, rental demand assessments, and a detailed review of any potential red flags.\nThis layered approach guarantees that every investment is well-suited to your goals, strategically located, acquired at the best possible value, and passes all due diligence to safeguard your investment.\n\nOur service is comprehensive and covers everything you need for a successful investment journey. This includes…\nPortfolio Assessment – Assessing your current portfolio to identify your position and potential opportunities. If you’re yet to start building a portfolio, we’ll guide you on what’s needed to achieve your investment goals.\nProperty Brief Creation – Developing a tailored brief for your next property based on your current situation and objectives.\nMarket Selection – Access to all our data to identify markets with strong growth potential.\nProperty Sourcing – Finding and negotiating the right properties that fit your brief.\nOngoing Support – Guiding you through the entire process right up until your property is tenanted.\nPost-Purchase Reviews – Regular check-ins with yearly reviews to ensure you’re on track to meet your investment goals.\nWe’re with you every step of the way!\n\nYou can invest in either residential or commercial properties.

Each of them provides their reasoning as well as insights on how to figure out if an area is still set for growth.\nSam Gordon, owner of Australian Property Scout and buyers agent of the year, highlights that predicting whether or not an area will perform all comes down to momentum. When momentum builds for an area, massive growth will follow.\n\n## Proven Strategy: How to grow your portfolio to the hundreds\n\n With 108 properties under his belt, Sam Gordon, who has become a household name in the Australian property investment scene, shares his expertise and strategies that helped him build his portfolio. In this episode of The Smart Property Investment Show, host Liam Garman sits down with Sam Gordon from Australian Property Scout to discuss how investors can scale their portfolios to hundreds.\nSam believes a portfolio should be treated like a business and advocates for a strategic approach, where properties are evaluated based on their performance and potential, which differs from the traditional “buy and hold forever” strategy.\nHe also advocates for a data-driven approach informed by extensive market research and urges investors to conduct thorough due diligence.\nThe podcast also delves into the nuances of risk management, tax considerations, and the importance of leveraging debt wisely.\n\n## What Sam Gordon Did to Build a 130+ Property Portfolio in Australia\n\n Meet Sam Gordon: The property hurricane redefining wealth, focus and grit in Australia’s market!\nEvery time Sam Gordon walks into a room, the energy shifts and this conversation was no exception. Sam’s not just a top 1% property investor; he’s a storm of clarity, strategy, and conviction.
