The master document is:\n**`memory/knowledge/MASTER-RESEARCH-SUMMARY.md`** — start here next session.\n\n---\n\n## What Was Completed (Full Research Phase)\n\n### Files Written (All Committed to Git)\n| File | Contents |\n|------|----------|\n| `memory/knowledge/MASTER-RESEARCH-SUMMARY.md` | ⭐ Full consolidated research — 10 sections, read this first |\n| `memory/knowledge/proppath-feature-map.md` | Full PropPath feature map, Tier 1–4, prioritised |\n| `memory/knowledge/proppath-model-statement.md` | Core product calibration — incremental vs simulation-first |\n| `memory/knowledge/competitors/05-investorkit.md` | InvestorKit full profile — business, team, FAQ, framework, cases |\n| `memory/knowledge/property-investment/07-investorkit-pure-deep-dive.md` | IK pure deep dive — no PropPath lens |\n| `memory/knowledge/property-investment/06-investorkit-vs-gameplans-model.md` | IK vs Gameplans model comparison |\n| `memory/knowledge/property-investment/04b-aps-deep-dive.md` | APS + School of Property — Trident Formula, curriculum |\n| `memory/knowledge/property-investment/08-property-nerds-episodes.md` | IK podcast episode archive + client pain point map |\n\n---\n\n## Key Findings (TL;DR)\n\n### The Problem\nBAs use Gameplans in live sessions to show portfolio plans. After the session, the plan disappears. Clients have no ongoing visibility. No living tool exists that keeps the plan alive between purchases.\n\n### The Product\n**PropPath = living portfolio roadmap.** BA builds it, client views it ongoing. Updates with reality, not just projections. Alerts both parties when it's time to buy again.\n\n### The Model\nPropPath is **incremental, not simulation-first** (aligned to InvestorKit, not Gameplans).\n\n### The Target Customer\n**InvestorKit is the ideal first customer.** They already believe in portfolio planning, use Gameplans, are scaling fast ($15M → $25M), and have the exact pain PropPath solves.\n\n### The 6 MVP Features\n1. Portfolio Roadmap Builder\n2. Goal Reverse-Engineering Engine\n3. Current Portfolio Dashboard\n4. Equity Trigger Alerts ⭐ (most valuable)\n5. Milestone Tracker\n6. Dual BA/Client Portal\n\n### The Positioning\n- Don't compete WITH Gameplans (different job). Compete for the GAP after Gameplans.\n- Headline: **\"Your portfolio plan, alive.\"**\n- Problem: \"BAs close clients with a plan. After the session, it disappears. PropPath keeps it alive.\"\n\n---\n\n## Next Actions (Pick Up Here Next Session)\n\n### Option A — Product Definition\nDefine the PropPath MVP in detail: user flows, data model, key screens. Start turning the feature map into a spec.\n\n### Option B — Knock Off Open Questions\n- What does Gameplans actually look like? (get access or screenshots)\n- What are the other top BAs using? (Metropole, Empower Wealth, Cohen Handler)\n- What is PropPath's pricing model?\n\n### Option C — Go-To-Market\n- Who are the 10 best BAs to pitch first?\n- What does the PropPath demo/sales motion look like?\n- Draft the IK outreach pitch\n\n---\n\n## Git Status\nAll files committed to main. No pending changes.\nLast commit: \"MASTER-RESEARCH-SUMMARY.md — research phase complete\"\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1771921204616}}
