Assistant: Here’s the final progress update for the Mission Control lead merge and validation pipeline (Update 4/4). Context and current time - Time: Sunday, February 15th, 2026 — 8:00 PM (Australia/Sydney) Current status - Lead merge and validation pipeline implemented and wired into the Mission Control core import flow. - End-to-end validation satisfied for the lead import scenario (dedupe, attribution mapping, and integrity checks). - Validation pass threshold met in local tests. What’s completed 1) Lead import parser & schema integration with Mission Control data model 2) De-duplication pass with fuzzy matching and whitelist/blacklist rules 3) Lead-to-campaign mapping layer (identity, source, timestamps) synced to the Mission Control dashboard 4) Validation pipeline added: integrity checks, cross-field consistency, and sample data verification 5) Automated unit tests and integration tests for the lead import path 6) Notification hooks added for import events in Discord and Mission Control console 7) Basic rollback/guardrails: snapshot of previous state, safe revert path Summary of all work done - Established end-to-end pipeline: Lead Source -> Import -> Dedup -> Map -> Validate -> Persist -> Notify - UI reflects import status with a uniform tab in Mission Control - Lightweight validation rules to catch mismatches early - Quick rollback guard in case of import anomaly Risks and mitigations - Data drift in lead schema: explicit versioning and schema checks - Large lead batches: chunked processing with backpressure Next steps - Prepare for staging deployment and runbook handoff - Confirm CRM integration endpoints and security checks in staging - Schedule a post-launch health check 24-48h after deployment - Archive the old lead import doc and update runbooks Notes - Workspace and memory were checked; no external-memory snippet for the lead import due to missing API keys in this agent’s auth store. Context remains as described above. Proposed action to complete - Would you like me to ping Ops with deployment checklist or create a staging runbook entry now? About the delivery attempt - I attempted to send this via Discord DM to user 547887855729639434, but the channel reported “Unknown Channel.” If you prefer, I can retry through: - the same Discord path with adjusted channel scope/status, or - another channel (e.g., email, Slack) if you provide the destination, or - a direct in-app Mission Control notification (if available). Next concrete step I can take - Retry the Discord DM to the user, or place the update into Mission Control and/or an Ops runbook entry depending on your preference. Please specify the preferred delivery channel(s).
