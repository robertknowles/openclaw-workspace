## What Makes InvestorKit Different

### 1. Data-First, Research-Led Approach
- Proprietary suburb-selection and investment modelling frameworks
- In-house research team identifies markets BEFORE the curve
- Rejects 92% of properties reviewed — only 8% pass due diligence
- 20-point due diligence checklist for every property
- 70% of deals sourced offline (not on major listing portals)
- Buying in 9–15 markets at any given time
- Has outperformed the national property market by 49%+ every year since inception

### 2. Private Banking Model (Segmented Team)
Arjun deliberately modelled IK on CBA's private banking structure:
- **Portfolio Strategist** — strategy sessions, buyer briefs, client lifecycle management
- **Research Team** — suburb selection, market data
- **Acquisitions Team** — negotiations, sourcing
- **Client Success/Onboarding** — post-purchase support, annual reviews
- Each client has one point of contact but accesses a team of specialists

### 3. National + Remote
- No local offices — fully remote/national
- Active across all Australian states
- "Borderless investing approach"

## The Portfolio Mapping Session — THE CRITICAL FEATURE

This is IK's core tool/process. Most similar to what PropPath does.

### What it is (from job description):
> "Conduct high-quality portfolio mapping sessions tailored to each client's goals and investment profile. Collaborate with brokers and acquisitions teams to generate accurate, actionable buyer briefs."

### What happens in a Portfolio Mapping Session:
1. Understand financial goals, investment experience, risk profile
2. Build a "tailored brief" — targets yield, capital growth, or cash flow balance
3. **Generate a portfolio plan** — forward-looking roadmap showing long-term impact
4. Collaborate with broker to validate borrowing capacity
5. Produce a "buyer brief" that drives acquisition

### What the Portfolio Plan produces (from case study):
> "Using their portfolio plan with InvestorKit, they can see the long term impact. The properties alone are on track to support an inflation adjusted passive income target above $100,000 per year in retirement, before including super."

**This is a visual/modelled roadmap** — not just a conversation. It projects:
- Portfolio value trajectory
- Passive income at target date (e.g. retirement)
- Inflation-adjusted projections
- Multi-property, multi-state view

### Portfolio Strategist role (from job posting — reveals what the tool does):
- Conduct portfolio mapping sessions
- Maintain CRM records (tasks, notes, stage tracking)
- **Lead monthly client review sessions** — ongoing, not just point-in-time
- Identify upsell opportunities (strategy → full service, or residential → commercial)
- Support clients through property rejections
- "Provide timely and ongoing strategic guidance to existing clients to support repeat purchases"

**KEY INSIGHT:** IK has *ongoing* monthly client reviews — not just a one-off session. The Portfolio Strategist nurtures the client between purchases. This is where the living roadmap happens — but it's human-delivered, not software-delivered.

## The Portfolio Wealth Accelerator

Mentioned in their campaign URL. From the snippet:
> "This mapping technology enables me to continuously monitor the performance of my portfolio and make informed decisions based on valuable insights. Clients of InvestorKit have also benefited from utilising this tool during their journey with our Buyer's Agents to enhance their investment strategies."

**This is almost certainly Gameplans** (or a similar tool) being used:
- "Mapping technology" = visual portfolio modelling
- "Continuously monitor performance" = ongoing tracking
- "Clients have benefited from utilising this tool during their journey" = client-facing during sessions

**IK uses Gameplans as their Portfolio Wealth Accelerator tool.** This is why IK is listed as a Gameplans customer.

## IK's Investment Strategy Framework

### The Three-Phase Cycle
From Amazon description of The Property Nerds podcast:
> "Acquire, Optimise, and Consolidate"

1. **Acquire** — find and buy the right property in the right market
2. **Optimise** — manage it, renovate if needed, maximise yield and equity
3. **Consolidate** — review portfolio, decide what to hold/sell, prepare for next acquisition

This is a *lifecycle framework* — not just buy and hold.

### How They Select Markets
- Macro: population growth, infrastructure, employment, supply/demand
- Micro: suburb-level data, vacancy rates, rental demand, comparable sales
- Avoiding herd mentality — often counter-cyclical
- Currently active in 9–15 markets at once

### Client Success Metrics IK Tracks
- Capital growth vs national average
- Rental yield performance
- Equity position (usable equity for next purchase)
- Passive income trajectory vs retirement goal
- Time to financial independence

- **Key quote:** "They no longer feel like retirement is an open question. They know time is now working in their favour."

### The "3 properties within 3 years" stat
- IK's headline claim: "most of our clients obtain 3 properties within 3 years"
- This pulls them into the top 10% of property investors in Australia

## InvestorKit's Tech Stack

- Uses Gameplans (Portfolio Wealth Accelerator) for visual portfolio modelling
- Proprietary data/research models (internal — not client-facing)
- CRM for client lifecycle tracking
- Remote-first operation — heavy reliance on video/digital tools

## Strategic Insight: Why IK is the Perfect PropPath Customer

1. **They already believe in portfolio planning** — it's their core product (Portfolio Mapping Session)
2. **They use Gameplans** — so they understand the value of visual modelling tools
3. **They have the monthly review problem** — a Portfolio Strategist manually does what PropPath automates
4. **They're scaling fast** — $15M → $25M revenue means more clients, more portfolio reviews needed, more strain on human-delivered sessions
5. **Their clients want ongoing tracking** — the Ryan & Lauren story shows clients want "peace of mind" and to know they're on track
6. **IK positions on data** — PropPath's data-driven roadmap aligns perfectly with their brand

**PropPath pitch to IK:**
> "You're doing portfolio mapping manually in sessions. We turn that into a living client dashboard. Your Portfolio Strategists spend less time on monthly reviews and more time on high-value strategy. Your clients get peace of mind between sessions."
