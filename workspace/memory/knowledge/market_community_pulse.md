# Market & Community Pulse — Australian Property Investment
*Last updated: 2026-02-22*

## Reddit Community Insights

### r/AusFinance (786K subscribers)
**Top themes:**
- DIY spreadsheet culture is pervasive — investors build their own tools
- Constant demand for "cash flow calculators" and "portfolio simulators"
- Skepticism about buyers agents: "you'll pay more with a BA" vs "worth every dollar"
- Investors constantly benchmarking property vs ETFs/HISA for risk-adjusted returns
- Negative gearing + CGT discount is THE dominant tax strategy discussion

**Key insight:** The DIY investor community distrusts BAs, but the serious multi-property investors use them. PropPath's early adopters are NOT DIY Reddit investors — they are BAs who serve serious investors.

### r/AusPropertyChat
**Top themes:**
- Which BA is worth it? (High engagement — people genuinely confused by the market)
- BAs mentioned frequently: Dashdot, Freedom Property Investors, Henderson Advocacy, Create Cashflow, InvestorKit
- Price sensitivity: BA fees feel expensive until results are shown
- Growing sophistication: investors asking about capital growth vs cash flow tradeoffs
- Rockhampton, regional QLD, Adelaide, Brisbane named as hot markets

**Key BA criticism from community:**
- "They just want to extract your maximum purchase price"
- "Hard to know if they have conflicts of interest"
- "Some are just developers in disguise"

**Key BA praise:**
- "Bought in Rockhampton for $344k, sold for $576k — fee was worth it"
- "They find off-market properties I could never find"
- "Saved me from emotional overspending"

### AusFinance Simulator Post — Critical Intelligence
Someone posted a DIY property investment simulator spreadsheet and listed its limitations:
- "Interest rate assumed static for full duration"
- "Relies on manually going to CBA loan calculator"
- "Every item should be commented"

**Takeaway:** Even sophisticated DIY investors build broken tools. There is genuine demand for something that works correctly and doesn't require manual maintenance.

## PropertyChat.com.au Community Intelligence

**"Tools of a Buyers Agent 2023" thread** (requested tools discussion for BAs):
- Community actively seeking what modern BAs use
- Discussion about PriceFinder and Real Estate Investar (data tools)
- BAs are pragmatic: they want data accuracy + time savings

**Software tools BAs discussed using:**
- CoreLogic / RP Data (market data, valuations)
- PriceFinder (comparable sales)
- Real Estate Investar (investment analysis)
- PropTrack (REA Group's data platform)
- Shared logins discussed (cost-sensitivity)

**Key insight:** BAs are price-sensitive on tools (they share logins to data platforms). The value proposition needs to be crystal clear. PropPath must demonstrate ROI — ideally "covers itself with the first client."

## Current Market Trends (2025-2026)

### Hot Markets (investor interest high)
1. **Regional Queensland** (Rockhampton, Toowoomba, Mackay) — cash flow + growth
2. **Adelaide** — strong growth, relative affordability
3. **Brisbane** — post-Olympics pipeline, infrastructure spending
4. **Perth** — strong fundamentals, WA economy
5. **Southeast QLD** — Sunshine Coast corridor

### Macroeconomic Context
- Interest rate peak passed; rate cuts expected
- Low housing supply + high migration = structural shortage
- Build-to-rent emerging as institutional play
- APRA lending restrictions shaping portfolio strategy (investors hit serviceability ceilings)
- Negative gearing + 50% CGT discount still key tax drivers

### Emerging Strategies
- **Commercial property** for yield diversification (6-9% yields vs residential 4-6%)
- **Dual occupancy / dual income** properties for cash flow
- **Hybrid rental** (short-term + long-term) to maximise yield
- **Rentvesting** — rent where you live, invest where it makes financial sense
- **Buy + Hold + Review** — structured 6-monthly portfolio reviews becoming standard

## What Investors & BAs Are Talking About (Pain Points)

### For Investors
1. **Complexity** — "I don't know where to start"
2. **Visualisation** — "I can't see how this all fits together"
3. **Confidence** — "I'm scared to make the wrong decision"
4. **Trust** — "How do I know the BA has my best interests?"
5. **Borrowing capacity** — "I don't know how many properties I can buy"
6. **Timeline** — "When can I retire on my portfolio?"

### For Buyers Agents
1. **Reporting time** — hours per client on spreadsheets
2. **Client communication** — spreadsheets confuse clients
3. **Differentiation** — hard to stand out in a crowded market
4. **Ongoing engagement** — clients go quiet after purchase, don't come back
5. **Referrals** — need to wow clients to get word-of-mouth
6. **Scale** — can't grow without systems that save time
7. **Proving value** — hard to quantify ROI of their service

## Key Insight for PropPath

**The market is ready but fragmented:**
- Gameplans has proven the model (400+ BAs, 4.8 stars, 6 years)
- But Gameplans appears to be primarily advisory/forecasting focused
- The ACQUISITION workflow (sourcing, shortlisting, client communication during purchase) is not well-served
- BAs need ONE tool that handles: strategy session → client roadmap → deal tracking → portfolio review
- The current stack: Gameplans (strategy) + spreadsheets (tracking) + email/CRM (client comms)

**PropPath's opportunity:**
- Be the full lifecycle tool — from first strategy session through ongoing portfolio management
- Make the visual roadmap so good it's a SALES tool for BAs (helps them close clients)
- Build the "equity notification" trigger (Gameplans has it, it's powerful)
- Price it so it "covers itself with the first client" — same framing as Gameplans
