## PropPath Competitive Positioning

### The Gap in the Market
Every tool in the BA tech stack solves sourcing, CRM, or data research. **Nobody solves portfolio planning.**

| Tool | What It Solves |
|------|---------------|
| Gameplans | Strategy session (one-time) |
| Open BA | Property sourcing + agent outreach |
| HTAG | Suburb data analytics |
| SystemsDU / BA-ICON | CRM + deal workflow |
| Monday.com | Generic task/pipeline management |
| **PropPath** | **ONGOING portfolio roadmap — what to buy next, in what order, and why** |

### PropPath's Unique Position
- **Sits above the entire stack** — PropPath is the strategic layer that ties everything together
- **Timeline:** Gameplans (strategy session) → **PropPath (ongoing roadmap)** → Open BA (execution)
- **Client retention tool for BAs** — keeps clients engaged between purchases
- **Visual** — no competitor shows portfolio growth as a journey/map
- **Multi-property** — designed for investors building portfolios, not buying one home

### Key Differentiator Statement
> "While Open BA helps BAs find properties and HTAG helps BAs research suburbs, PropPath is the tool that shows every client exactly where they are in their property journey, what they should buy next, and what their portfolio looks like in 10 years."
