# PropPath — Competitive Positioning
*Draft v1 — 2026-02-22*

## The Problem We Solve

Buyers Agents have excellent tools for **finding** properties.  
They have nothing for **planning** portfolios.

The gap: After a BA completes a strategy session with a client, there is no tool that:
- Shows the client their full multi-property roadmap
- Visualises portfolio growth over time
- Helps the BA recommend what to buy next (and when)
- Keeps the client engaged between purchases

BAs currently cobble this together with spreadsheets, PDFs, and Gameplans session outputs.

## The Market

**Target user:** Investment-focused Buyers Agents in Australia  
**Target client:** Property investors building multi-property portfolios  
**Market size:** ~3,000–5,000 active buyers agents in Australia, ~500–1,000 investment-focused

## The BA Tech Stack (where PropPath fits)

```
Phase 1: Strategy Session
  └─ Gameplans — one-time client strategy session tool

Phase 2: Portfolio Planning  ← THIS IS WHERE PROPPATH LIVES
  └─ PropPath — ongoing portfolio roadmap (what to buy, when, in what sequence)

Phase 3: Suburb Research
  └─ HTAG — suburb analytics, heatmaps, portfolio modelling (data layer)

Phase 4: Property Sourcing
  └─ Open BA — agent outreach, off-market listings, AI property reviews

Phase 5: Deal Management
  └─ SystemsDU / BA-ICON — CRM, client management, contracts

Phase 6: Data & Compliance
  └─ RP Data / Pricefinder, Xero, Docusign
```

**PropPath is the strategic layer that ties Phases 1–3 together.**

## Key Messages (for sales conversations)

### For Buyers Agents:
> "PropPath is the portfolio planning tool you've been building in spreadsheets — now visual, professional, and client-ready. Show every client exactly where they are in their property journey, what they should buy next, and what their portfolio looks like in 10 years."

### Against Open BA objection ("we already use Open BA"):
> "Open BA helps you find the property. PropPath helps you and your client decide WHAT to buy next, based on their portfolio strategy. They work together — Open BA executes, PropPath plans."

### Against HTAG objection ("we use HTAG for portfolio modelling"):
> "HTAG's portfolio modelling is suburb-focused — it shows which suburbs perform. PropPath is client-focused — it shows your client's entire investment roadmap across multiple properties and time. They're different layers."

### Against "we use spreadsheets":
> "Spreadsheets don't retain clients. PropPath turns your portfolio strategy into a visual, shareable roadmap that keeps clients coming back to you for their next purchase."
