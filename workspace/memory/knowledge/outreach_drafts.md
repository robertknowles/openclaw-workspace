## Email 1: Sam Gordon — Australian Property Scout

**To:** sam@australianpropertyscout.com.au (or via contact form at australianpropertyscout.com.au)
**Subject:** The tool that tracks what happens after the strategy session

Hi Sam,

Your "Retire 500 by 2030" mission is one of the clearest value propositions I've seen from any BA in Australia. 500 families with financially independent futures — that's a meaningful goal, and it requires a meaningful system to deliver it at scale.

I'm building PropPath — a visual portfolio planning tool designed specifically for investment-focused buyers' agents. Think of it as the layer that sits after the strategy session: tracking equity unlock moments, modelling next-purchase timelines, and giving clients a living dashboard of their property roadmap rather than a PDF they file away.

The problem I'm solving: BAs do brilliant strategy work upfront, then lose visibility the moment acquisition begins. Clients drift. Equity milestones get missed. The "buy again in 18 months" conversation never happens because no one's tracking when that trigger actually hits.

PropPath fixes that — so your 500 clients stay engaged, keep buying through you, and actually reach the finish line.

I'd love 20 minutes to show you what we're building and get your honest take on whether it solves a real problem in your workflow.

Are you open to a call in the next couple of weeks?

Best,
Rob Knowles

**Personalisation notes:**
- References "Retire 500 by 2030" mission directly
- Acknowledges his scale (AFR Fast 100, 80+ properties personally)
- Positions PropPath as post-strategy, not competing with his process
- No pitch deck link — keeps it low-friction, leads with the problem

## Email 2: Arjun Paliwal — InvestorKit

**To:** arjun@investorkit.com.au (or via investorkit.com.au/contact)
**Subject:** A question from a listener — and something you might find useful

---

Hi Arjun,

Long-time listener of Property Nerds. Your episode on APRA buffers and serviceability constraints was one of the clearest explanations I've found — the way you framed the 3% buffer as a portfolio design constraint (not just a compliance hurdle) reframed how I think about the scaling problem.

I'm building PropPath — a visual portfolio planning tool for investment-focused buyers' agents. I noticed InvestorKit already uses Gameplans for strategy sessions (great tool). PropPath is designed for what comes next: tracking live equity positions, modelling acquisition timelines, and keeping clients engaged between purchases.

The gap I keep hearing about from BAs: after the strategy session, clients go quiet, equity milestones get missed, and the "you're ready to buy again" conversation happens too late or not at all. PropPath automates that — it pings the BA when a client's equity crosses the next deposit threshold, with the modelling to back up the conversation.

Given InvestorKit's volume and your focus on data-driven investing, I think you'd have a sharp view on whether this solves a real workflow problem — or whether BAs are solving it some other way I haven't seen yet.

Would you be open to a 20-minute call? Happy to share what we're building and genuinely interested in your feedback.

Best,
Rob Knowles

**Personalisation notes:**
- Opens as a listener, not a cold pitch — establishes credibility first
- References Property Nerds podcast specifically (not generic)
- Acknowledges Gameplans (Arjun is featured on their homepage) — shows research, positions PropPath as complementary not competing
- APRA buffer reference ties to his known content focus
- Asks for feedback, not a sale — low-friction ask

## Follow-up template (7-day bump)

**Subject:** Re: [original subject]

Hi [Name],

Just bumping this up in case it got buried. Happy to send a short Loom walkthrough if that's easier than a call.

Rob
