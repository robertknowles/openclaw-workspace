## Core Investment Strategies

### Capital Growth vs Cash Flow — The Fundamental Debate

This is THE central debate in Australian property investing.

**Capital Growth Strategy**
- Buy in high-demand, supply-constrained locations (close to CBDs, infrastructure corridors)
- Appreciates faster: typically 7%+ annually in growth corridors
- Usually negatively geared — costs exceed rental income, but ATO allows tax deductions
- Use growing equity to buy the next property (the "equity ladder")
- Not taxed until you sell (50% CGT discount if held 12+ months)
- Example: $450k property at 7% growth = $31,500/yr equity gain, $480/wk rent

**Cash Flow (Positive Gearing) Strategy**
- Buy in regional/higher-yield areas
- Rental income exceeds costs — positively geared from day one
- Less capital growth: typically 3% in cash flow regions
- Example: $450k at 3% growth = $13,500/yr equity, $700/wk rent
- Taxed as regular income each year — less tax-efficient long term

**The Expert Consensus (2025)**
- *Capital growth first* — build equity to scale portfolio, then balance with cash flow
- Cash flow too early = limits long-term wealth creation
- Best portfolios combine both: growth assets early, cash flow assets for stability later
- Sam Gordon (APS): buys growth assets in his 20s, diversifying for cash flow at scale by 30s
- "Cash flow keeps you in the game. Capital growth builds the wealth." — SearchProperty

## How Equity Works (The Core PropPath Mechanism)

1. Buy property at 80% LVR (20% deposit)
2. Property grows in value → market value > loan balance = EQUITY
3. Bank allows reborrowing against equity (typically to 80% LVR of new value)
4. Use equity as deposit on next property — without selling anything
5. Portfolio compounds: each property potentially funds the next
6. **The "equity unlock moment"** = when usable equity crosses the next deposit threshold

**Usable Equity Formula:**
`Usable equity = (Current value × 0.80) - Outstanding loan`

Example: Property bought for $600k, now worth $750k, loan $480k
- Max borrowing at 80%: $750k × 0.80 = $600k
- Outstanding loan: $480k
- **Usable equity: $120k** → enough deposit for a $600k next purchase

This is WHY "equity notification" (Gameplans feature) is so powerful — investors desperately want to know THIS moment.

## The Australian Investor Journey — Stages

**Stage 1: Discovery** (0 properties)
- Goal: understand if property investing is right for them
- Pain: overwhelmed, don't know where to start
- Need: clarity, simple models, trust in a guide

**Stage 2: First Purchase** (1 property)
- Goal: get on the ladder without overpaying
- Pain: fear of wrong decision, don't understand numbers
- Need: strategy session, scenario modelling, confidence to commit
- *This is where BAs earn their fee and PropPath delivers its core value*

**Stage 3: Portfolio Building** (2-5 properties)
- Goal: scale strategically using equity
- Pain: serviceability constraints (APRA), managing complexity
- Need: portfolio tracking, equity monitoring, next-buy timing
- *This is where ongoing PropPath subscriptions become sticky and sticky*

**Stage 4: Portfolio Optimisation** (5+ properties)
- Goal: rebalance for cash flow, reduce risk, plan retirement exit
- Pain: tax complexity, refinancing timing, asset selection
- Need: holistic view, cash flow modelling, adviser coordination
- *Highest-value BA client — most profitable relationship*

## Key Australian Property Concepts

### Borrowing Capacity / Serviceability
- Banks assess ability to service all debt on your income
- APRA mandates stress-testing at 3% ABOVE current rate (confirmed July 2025 — buffer staying at 3%)
- If actual rate is 6%, bank assesses at 9%
- Rental income shading: banks only count 70-80% of gross rent towards income
- Credit card LIMITS (not balances) are counted as debts — $20k limit = $20k liability
- Living expenses: assessed at HEM (Household Expenditure Measure), often overestimates frugal investors
- "Hitting the serviceability wall" = can't borrow more despite having equity
- Solution: "policy shopping" across lenders with an investment-savvy broker

### LVR (Loan-to-Value Ratio)
- LVR = Loan / Property Value × 100
- Above 80% LVR = LMI (Lenders Mortgage Insurance) required — avoid this
- Standard investment: 80% LVR (20% deposit equivalent)

### Negative Gearing (Australia's Dominant Strategy)
- When property costs > rental income = a loss
- That annual loss offsets other taxable income (salary, wages)
- Deductible expenses: loan interest, council/water rates, insurance, maintenance, property management fees, depreciation
- NOT deductible: principal repayments, capital improvements
- **Negative gearing rules unchanged as of 2025** — full deductions still apply
- Combined with 50% CGT discount = the dominant Australian wealth strategy
- Policy risk: Labor has proposed restricting it, but hasn't done so yet

**Example:**
- Rental income: $25,000/yr
- Expenses: $30,000/yr
- Loss: $5,000 → deducted from salary income → reduces tax bill by ~$2,250 (at 45% tax bracket)

### Depreciation (Hidden Tax Benefit)
Two categories:
- **Division 43 (Capital Works)**: Building structure — 2.5% per year over 40 years. Starts from construction completion date. Only properties built after 1985 (residential) or 1982 (commercial).
- **Division 40 (Plant & Equipment)**: Removable assets (carpets, appliances, hot water systems) — depreciated at higher rates (10-40%/yr depending on effective life)
- Typical annual depreciation claim: **$5,000–$15,000** especially in early years
- New properties: claim both Div 43 + Div 40
- Older properties (pre-1985): Div 40 only on NEW assets added by current owner
- Requires a Quantity Surveyor to prepare a depreciation schedule (~$700 one-off cost)

### Land-to-Asset Ratio
- Land appreciates; buildings depreciate
- High land content = better capital growth
- Houses on land > units/apartments for growth
- BAs always quote land-to-asset ratio when justifying growth potential

### Gross vs Net Yield
- Gross yield = (Annual rent / Property value) × 100
- Net yield = (Annual rent - All expenses) / Property value × 100
- Gross yield 5-6%+ = decent cash flow; net yield 3-4% after costs
- Regional properties often 6-8% gross; metro 3-4% gross
- BAs often quote gross yield — important to know the difference

## BA Business Economics (Confirmed 2025)

### Fee Structures
Three main models:

**Fixed Fee (most common for investment BAs)**
- Full service: $8,000–$15,000+ depending on property price
- Tiered by bracket: $250-500k → $6k; $500-750k → $9k; $750k-$1M → $12k
- Negotiation/auction only: $2,500–$6,000

**Percentage of Purchase Price**
- Range: 0.9%–3% nationally
- Brisbane: 1–2.7% typical
- On $700k property at 2% = $14,000

**Strategy Session (Add-On)**
- Gameplans-powered sessions: BAs charge $2,000–$5,000 EXTRA
- This is where PropPath/Gameplans ROI lives most clearly

### Revenue Per Client (Estimated)
- Average investment property ~$700-900k
- Typical full-service fee: $10,000–$15,000
- Investment BAs offering strategy sessions: **$12,000–$20,000 per client**
- Top-tier agencies (InvestorKit, APS, Dashdot): likely $15,000–$25,000 per engagement
- Repeat buyer clients (3rd+ property): most loyal, most profitable

### TAM
- 2016: ~500 buyers agents (PIPA)
- 2025: **1,000+** (doubled in under a decade)
- 40% of first-home buyers considered using a BA in 2023 (PIPA)
- 85% of clients say BA secured a better deal than they could alone (REBAA 2023)
- **Serviceable market for PropPath: ~500-700 investment-focused BAs**
- ARR potential: 500 BAs × $200/mo = $1.2M ARR from BA tier alone

## The Strategy Session — What Actually Happens

Based on research across multiple BA firm pages:

**Standard Strategy Session Process:**
1. Client books call/meeting (often free discovery call first, 15-30 mins)
2. Paid strategy session (1-3 hours): BA collects full financial picture
   - Income, savings rate, existing properties
   - Risk tolerance, investment horizon
   - Goals: retirement age, passive income target, lifestyle goals
3. BA models scenarios live (this is where Gameplans/PropPath is used):
   - "If you buy 2 properties vs 3, here's your 30yr trajectory"
   - "Growth vs cash flow mix — here's the difference at year 20"
   - "Here's when you can buy again based on your equity growth"
4. Client sees their financial future visually → gains confidence → commits to the plan
5. BA converts client to full-service acquisition engagement
6. Client remembers this session as the moment "it all clicked"

**Key quotes from BA websites about strategy sessions:**
- "Where you are right now, where you want to be, and your next action steps" (Pumped on Property)
- "Assess your current portfolio and incorporate existing holdings into new strategy" (Aus Property Professionals)
- "After your free strategy session, most clients feel empowered with a clear roadmap" (GetRare)
- "We discuss how you make your money when you buy, not just when you sell" (Aus Property Professionals)

**PropPath's role: Steps 3-5. This is the money moment.**

## Sam Gordon (APS) — Deep Strategy Intel

Key lessons from his 100+ property portfolio journey:

**His actual strategy:**
- Started at age 19, income $39,000/yr
- "For 10 years, no holidays, no new cars, every dollar into property"
- "For seven years, my holidays were renovations"
- Drove a used one-tonne truck instead of a luxury car for years
- Focus: buy below market value, add value through renovation, use equity to repeat

**Investment philosophy:**
- Buy properties with strong equity growth potential
- Renovate strategically to manufacture equity (don't wait for market)
- Buy below market value — "off-market opportunities where clients can secure deals others don't know exist"
- "Shift from acting rich to being wealthy"
- "Short-term sacrifice for long-term gain"

**APS Podcast (Scouting Australia):**
- Co-host: James Ibrahim (experienced investor)
- Recent episode: 5 properties in 12 months (Darwin-based clients Nathan + Katelyn)
- Tone: practical, results-focused, motivational
- AFR Fast 100 company — serious credibility signal

**Why this matters for PropPath:**
- Sam's clients go through EXACTLY the process PropPath supports
- "Retire 500 by 2030" = 500 people who each need a PropPath-style visual plan
- Sam is a direct outreach target — early adopter potential

- LPI Buyers Agency: "As a property valuer and buyers agent, I've trialled plenty of tools — nothing comes close to GamePlans"

**Pricing intelligence (still unconfirmed):**
- "Your platform fee gets covered with your first client" (homepage)
- BAs charge $2k-$5k+ per strategy session using Gameplans
- No subscription tier published publicly
- GetApp listing shows "$19/mo starting from" — likely a DIFFERENT "GamePlan" project mgmt tool, NOT property Gameplans

**Gameplans' unaddressed gap (confirmed by their own marketing):**
- They explicitly say Step 3 makes you their "strategic partner for LIFE" and "every future purchase flows through you"
- But their tool is advisory/forecasting only — no acquisition workflow, no deal tracking, no ongoing portfolio management after purchase
- A BA using Gameplans still needs spreadsheets + CRM for everything after the strategy session
