# HANDOFF.md — Session State Save
*Saved: Feb 2026 — mid-research session*

## What Was Done This Session

### 1. Compiled Master Feature Map ✅
- `memory/knowledge/proppath-feature-map.md` — full PropPath feature map, Tier 1–4, Gameplans gap table
- Sourced from all 5 knowledge docs

### 2. PropPath Model Statement ✅
- `memory/knowledge/proppath-model-statement.md` — critical calibration doc
- Rob's framing: "PropPath is incremental, not simulation-first"
- Defines InvestorKit model vs Gameplans model, correct audit questions, wrong audit questions
- Also saved as `memory/knowledge/property-investment/06-investorkit-vs-gameplans-model.md`

### 3. Rob's Direction Mid-Session
- Rob said: **stop comparing to PropPath for now — do a pure InvestorKit deep dive**
- Then confirmed: APS deep media archive (98+ lessons, SMSF module, curriculum) and InvestorKit FAQ/Portfolio Strategist job/Property Nerds episodes were NOT properly saved from a prior session
- Asked to run both in tandem

---

## Current Active Task: Two-Track Research (MID-FLIGHT, NOT YET SAVED)

### Track A — InvestorKit Deep Dive

**Raw data fetched this session, NOT yet written to files:**

#### InvestorKit FAQ (full content retrieved) — Key findings:
- Buys in 9–15 markets at any time
- Does NOT buy: new builds, NDIS, units/apartments, knockdown rebuilds, major renovation properties
- Entry requirements: ~$100k equity/funds minimum; residential min $525k, SMSF min $575k; commercial $2M–$10M+
- SMSF and Trust purchases: yes, they do both
- Timeline to purchase: 1–4 months depending on brief specificity
- Post-purchase: regular check-ins + **annual reviews with strategist**
- Service includes: Portfolio Assessment, Property Brief Creation, Market Selection, Property Sourcing, Ongoing Support, Post-Purchase Reviews

#### Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate (confirmed from SPI article, June 2024):
- Arjun Paliwal explicitly laid this out on The Property Nerds podcast
- Key quote: "acquire, optimise, and consolidate" — the cycle for scaling portfolios
- Context: balance aggressive wealth building with enjoying life (personal note from Arjun in that episode)

#### Portfolio Wealth Accelerator page:
- URL: `investorkit.com.au/campaign/ultimate-property-toolkit/portfolio-wealth-accelerator/`
- Now redirects to homepage — page is gone/archived
- Snippet captured: *"acquire properties in a strategic manner that may give you a security net and potentially help you jump from one property to another fast and compounds with time, increasing passive income"*
- This was a content/campaign page, NOT a software product page — now confirmed PWA is a content framework, not a standalone tool

#### InvestorKit Portfolio Stage Framework (confirmed from Raj & Sowji case study):
Three explicit stages used with clients:
1. **Foundation** — major market, larger price points (blue chip capital city assets)
2. **Momentum** — affordable prices, spread across the nation, data-driven location (any city)
3. **Passive** — commercial and unit blocks for cash flow ("forward moving assets — you don't take one step back, two steps forward")

Quote: *"Assets where you don't take one step back, two steps forward like in residential. You simply take a step forward as cash flow is present from day one and growth continues to accumulate in the remainder of the portfolio."*

#### Success Stories Scraped:
- **Michael** — 13 properties, $16.54M, $2.8M equity in 5 years, 5 states, residential → commercial. Key: "foundational residential → momentum regional → commercial"
- **Raj & Sowji** — 8 properties, $9M+, 4 states. Foundation → Momentum → now moving to commercial passive assets
- **Dani & Ron** — 4 assets, $3.5M, 4 years, rentvesting
- **Lorna** — 1 to 5 properties in 2.5 years
- **Daniel** — 7 purchases, 4 states, 4 years

#### Property Nerds Podcast:
- Hosts: Arjun Paliwal (InvestorKit), Jack Fouracre (Fouracre Financial), Adrian (Senior Portfolio Strategist, InvestorKit)
- Published on Smart Property Investment network AND standalone feed
- Episode list not yet fully scraped — Apple Podcasts page returned limited content

---

### Track B — School of Property (APS) Curriculum

**Raw data fetched this session, NOT yet written to files:**

#### What's confirmed:
- **12 modules** confirmed (from search snippet: "12 modules with sharp and practical videos")
- Platform: Kajabi (schoolofproperty.mykajabi.com)
- Lifetime access to all content including new additions
- Includes: resource libraries, expert panel access, course portal
- Positioning: "gold standard in property investment education"
- Designed for beginners to experts — "a clear, results-driven roadmap"

#### What's NOT yet retrieved:
- Full module/lesson list (the 98+ lessons figure from prior session is unverified in current files)
- SMSF module specifics
- Portfolio blueprint structure details
- Pricing

#### APS Media page found:
- `australianpropertyscout.com.au/media/` — Sam appeared with Jimmy to break down curriculum outline
- This is likely the richest source for the full lesson breakdown — **NOT YET FETCHED**

---

## Exact Next Actions (Resume Here)

### Priority 1 — Write up InvestorKit findings to file
Save everything from Track A above into updated `memory/knowledge/competitors/05-investorkit.md`:
- Full FAQ content
- Three-stage framework (Foundation → Momentum → Passive) with Raj & Sowji quotes
- Michael case study detail (foundation → momentum → commercial journey)
- Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate confirmation + context
- Portfolio Wealth Accelerator clarification (content framework, not software)
- Annual reviews confirmed as standard (not monthly — FAQ says "annual")

### Priority 2 — Fetch APS media page for curriculum breakdown
URL: `australianpropertyscout.com.au/media/`
Then fetch: `schoolofproperty.com.au/what-we-do/` and `schoolofproperty.com.au/homework-page/`
Goal: get the 12 module names + lesson structure, confirm 98+ lessons figure, SMSF module

### Priority 3 — Property Nerds episode list
Fetch full episode archive from InvestorKit podcast page or Apple Podcasts
Goal: list of episode topics → what strategies/issues IK addresses in their content

### Priority 4 — Pure InvestorKit synthesis doc
Rob wants a deep IK doc with NO PropPath lens.
Write: `memory/knowledge/property-investment/07-investorkit-pure-deep-dive.md`
Should cover: business model, team structure, client lifecycle, three-stage framework, Acquire/Optimise/Consolidate, FAQ intel, case study patterns, what IK clients actually experience end-to-end

---

## Open Questions (Rob Has Not Answered Yet)
- Does Rob want the pure IK doc first, or the files saved first?
- Does Rob want to go deeper on The Property Nerds episode topics?
- Next task after IK deep dive — return to PropPath feature map, or something else?

## Files Written This Session
- `memory/knowledge/proppath-feature-map.md` ✅
- `memory/knowledge/proppath-model-statement.md` ✅
- `memory/knowledge/property-investment/06-investorkit-vs-gameplans-model.md` ✅

- Three-stage framework + case studies → same
- School of Property 12 modules confirmation → `property-investment/04b-aps-deep-dive.md` update
