## CRITICAL NEW FINDING: InvestorKit

**InvestorKit is THE closest comparable to PropPath's vision.** Rob flagged this himself.

### Key Facts:
- Founder: Arjun Paliwal, ex-CBA banker
- Revenue: $3.6M → $7.6M → $15M → forecast $23–25M (fastest growing BA in AU)
- Awards: REB Buyers Agency of the Year 2023 AND 2024
- 80+ staff, 1,200+ client families, 2,000+ purchases
- Podcast: The Property Nerds

### Their "Portfolio Mapping Session" (= PropPath's core product):
- Deep dive on client's financial position + goals
- Build a long-term portfolio plan (income target, property sequence, timeline)
- Plan shows path to e.g. $100K passive income/year at retirement
- Client references this plan throughout the entire BA engagement
- Monthly review sessions built in
- BUT: plan lives with the BA, not the client. No client portal. No self-serve dashboard.

### Their Tool Stack:
- "Portfolio Wealth Accelerator" / "mapping technology" = almost certainly Gameplans
- BA-facing only — client can't log in independently
- InvestorKit IS listed as a Gameplans client (confirmed in prior research)

### InvestorKit's Framework (Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate):
1. Acquire — buy next property aligned to plan
2. Optimise — refinance, rent reviews, property management
3. Consolidate — review position, assess capacity, prepare for next cycle

### PropPath Opportunity:
- InvestorKit would be a **target customer** (not competitor) for PropPath
- Every touchpoint in their process is a PropPath feature:
  - Portfolio mapping session → PropPath roadmap builder
  - Monthly reviews → PropPath dashboard
  - Buyer briefs → PropPath "next purchase" module
  - Upsell triggers → PropPath equity alerts

## Exact Next Actions (Resume Here)

### Priority 1 — APS Deep Dive (partially done)
- School of Property curriculum: schoolofproperty.com.au — what modules do they teach?
- Useful for understanding what investors learn + what they need visualised

### Priority 2 — InvestorKit Further Research (optional)
- Can go deeper on The Property Nerds podcast episodes for strategy content
- Their "Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate" cycle needs more detail

### Priority 3 — PropPath Feature Map (NEXT MAJOR TASK)
**This is the synthesis step.** Build a comprehensive PropPath feature map using:
- All 5 knowledge docs
- Gameplans gap analysis (from doc 03)
- InvestorKit Portfolio Mapping Session breakdown (doc 05)
- APS 3 deal types framework (doc 04)

Output: A definitive list of PropPath features, prioritised by impact + feasibility.

### Priority 4 — Gameplans Deep Dive (STILL QUEUED)
- Pricing, full feature set, what the output actually looks like
- Screenshots / demo videos if findable

---

## Open Questions
- Does Gameplans have a client portal / ongoing access?
- What is Gameplans' pricing for BAs?
- What does the Gameplans output actually look like?
- Should PropPath's portfolio plan visualise the Acquire→Optimise→Consolidate cycle?
- Should PropPath show the "3 deal type" sequencing (B&B → Cash Flow → Growth)?
- Does PropPath need a borrowing capacity calculator built in?
