## The Core Premise

Australian property investment is built on one simple mechanic: **leverage compounding over time**.

A single amount of capital, deployed into property, generates equity through growth. That equity is recycled into the next purchase. Repeat. Each cycle builds faster than the last because the asset base is growing.

This is why BAs who manage multi-property clients are so valuable — they're guiding clients through a **sequenced, multi-decade strategy**, not just finding one house.

## Key Metrics Every Investor Must Understand

### 1. Capital Growth
- The increase in a property's value over time
- Australian historical average: ~7% p.a. (varies heavily by city/suburb)
- **The primary wealth engine** for long-term investors
- Compounding: a $500k property at 7% p.a. = ~$1M in 10 years, ~$2M in 20 years

### 2. Rental Yield
- Annual rental income ÷ property value × 100
- **Gross yield:** Rent / Property Price (ignores costs)
- **Net yield:** (Rent - Costs) / Property Price (real number)
- Example: $500/week rent on $600k property = 4.3% gross yield
- Rule of thumb: yields above 4–5% = good cash flow; below 3% = growth market
- **Capital growth and yield are often inversely correlated** — high-growth cities have lower yields; regional areas have higher yields but lower growth

### 3. Cash Flow
- Money in (rent) minus money out (mortgage, rates, insurance, management, maintenance)
- **Positive gearing:** Rent > expenses. Property pays for itself. Better for serviceability.
- **Negative gearing:** Rent < expenses. Investor tops up the shortfall. Loss is tax-deductible against income.
- Most investment properties in major Australian cities are negatively geared — investors accept the shortfall in exchange for capital growth

### 4. LVR (Loan-to-Value Ratio)
- Loan amount ÷ Property value × 100
- Example: $400k loan on $500k property = 80% LVR
- Banks typically lend up to 80% without Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI)
- **80% LVR is the magic number** — go above it and you pay LMI (often $5–15k+)
- As property grows in value, LVR naturally decreases → creates accessible equity

### 5. Equity
- Property value minus outstanding loan
- Example: Property worth $700k, loan $400k → equity = $300k
- **Usable equity:** Banks typically allow you to borrow up to 80% of property value
  - $700k × 80% = $560k available
  - $560k - $400k loan = **$160k usable equity** (deposit for next purchase)

### 6. Serviceability
- A bank's assessment of whether you can afford to repay a loan
- Calculated on income vs. existing debt obligations
- Investors often hit serviceability walls before equity walls — income limits how many properties they can hold
- Fix: increase income, buy higher-yielding properties, use different lenders (different assessment rates)

### 7. Negative Gearing + Tax Benefits
- Losses from investment property reduce taxable income
- Also: depreciation (non-cash deduction on building and fixtures)
- Depreciation schedules from quantity surveyors can add $5–15k/year in deductions
- CGT (Capital Gains Tax): 50% discount on gains if held 12+ months

### 8. Borrowing Capacity
- The maximum total debt a lender will extend
- Assessed at buffer rate (~3% above current rate)
- In 2024–25: rates at ~6–7%, assessed at 9–10%
- This is why borrowing capacity has shrunk significantly since 2022 rate rises

## The Australian Market Structure

### City vs Regional
| | Major Cities (Syd/Mel/Bris) | Regional |
|-|-----|------|
| Capital Growth | High (long term) | Moderate |
| Rental Yield | Lower (3–4%) | Higher (5–7%) |
| Entry Price | Higher | Lower |
| Liquidity | High | Lower |
| Vacancy Risk | Lower | Higher |

### Property Types
| Type | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| House + Land | Best capital growth, full control | Higher entry, maintenance |
| Townhouse | Mid-ground, lower maint | Body corporate, less land |
| Unit/Apartment | Low entry, good yield | Slower growth, oversupply risk, body corporate |
| Commercial | High yield (6–10%), long leases | Higher entry, vacancy risk, economic sensitivity |
| Dual Occ / Duplex | High yield + equity manufacture | Council approval, higher complexity |

### Market Cycle (4 Phases)
1. **Upturn** — Prices rising from bottom, good buying opportunity, sentiment turning positive
2. **Boom** — Strong price growth, FOMO buying, media coverage, yields compressing
3. **Downturn** — Prices plateau or fall, negative sentiment, but fundamentals still solid
4. **Stabilisation** — Bottom of market, low transaction volumes, serious buyers active

**The 18.6-year cycle theory** (land value cycles) — broadly followed by serious investors. Australia doesn't follow it perfectly but the ~14-year growth / 4-year contraction pattern has historical backing.

## The Core Investor Goal Framework

Most investment-focused BAs help clients with ONE of these goals:
1. **Financial independence / passive income** — building a portfolio that generates enough rent to live on
2. **Retirement fund** — replacing super with property equity
3. **Wealth transfer** — building assets to pass to children
4. **Short-term equity gain** — manufacturing equity through renovation/development

The sequencing of properties purchased depends entirely on the goal.

## PropPath Relevance

Every metric above is something PropPath should **visualise** across a client's portfolio:
- Show current LVR per property + across portfolio
- Show equity growth trajectory
- Show projected cash flow at current vs future property counts
- Map which property to buy next based on equity available + serviceability
- Show the "retirement date" — when passive income > living expenses

This is the *portfolio roadmap* no tool currently provides visually.
