# Australian Property Scout — Deep Dive (Part 2)
*Research: Feb 2026 — School of Property, podcast content, strategy framework*

---

## School of Property (schoolofproperty.com.au)

APS's education arm — a paid course/program separate from the BA service.

**Positioning:** "The ultimate roadmap to property investing success... No fluff, no un-tested theory — just the exact blueprint that has helped thousands of everyday Australians build life-changing wealth."

**What it covers (from podcast description):**
- Fundamentals of property investing
- Proven portfolio blueprint
- Advanced investor strategies
- Tools to futureproof success
- Curriculum for both beginners and experts

**Real outcomes from School of Property clients:**
- Bailey: started with $60k equity, built 3-property portfolio in 12 months → $480k equity created
- Adam & Kerry: built $2.136M portfolio in 12 months → $530k equity unlocked

**Key episode:** "Inside the School of Property" — Sam + Head of Education Brendan Geoghegan broke down the curriculum, modules, and lessons. Released Nov 2024.

**Why it matters for PropPath:** School of Property is the education layer; PropPath could be the *ongoing execution layer* — the living dashboard that students use after they've learned the blueprint.

## APS Strategy Framework — Confirmed Deep Detail

### The Portfolio Blueprint Process (APS)
1. Strategy session — understand goals, experience, finances
2. Reverse engineer to income target (e.g. $100k/yr = 4 properties × $25k yield)
3. Set timeframe + purchase frequency based on borrowing capacity
4. Education-first: before sourcing, educate client on why that market/property
5. Source + negotiate (off-market network)
6. Support + reinvest — stay in touch, coordinate broker/accountant, trigger next cycle

### Key Podcast Topics (Scouting Australia — ongoing intel)
From episode chapter lists — these are the things APS clients think about:

**Portfolio building mechanics:**
- "3 properties off 1 deposit" — the signature APS outcome
- "12 properties in 3 years" — aggressive scaling case study
- Buy and hold myth busted (2024)
- When to sell vs hold

**Finance & serviceability:**
- What to do when banks say no
- SMSF strategies
- Interest rates vs inflation
- Low-risk to banks: how to position yourself

**Market selection:**
- How to pick a growth market
- Understanding data
- Investing against the herd (myth-busting)
- Blue collar vs blue chip

**Deal types:**
- Bread & butter (3-part series)
- Cash flow dead? (full episode)
- Manufactured equity (renovation focus)
- Commercial transition (advanced, larger portfolios)

**Mistakes:**
- Overconfidence after initial success
- House & land packages — "Trifecta of Idiocy" (APS strongly against OTP/H&L)
- Getting distracted by luxury spending (kills borrowing capacity)
- Not diversifying geographically
- Impatience (long-term game)
- A more expensive property isn't a better investment

**Mindset:**
- Sacrifice for long-term freedom
- 92% of Australians never own more than 1-2 properties
- Running your own race
- Community/accountability

### APS Anti-patterns (What They Tell Clients NOT to Do)
- House & land packages (OTP) — explicitly called "Trifecta of Idiocy"
- Buying locally (emotional, expensive, wrong yield)
- Luxury cars / lifestyle spending before wealth is built
- Going it alone without specialists
- Working with inexperienced advisors
- Selling too early

## APS Business Scale (Context for PropPath)

- 80+ full-time staff across InvestorKit Group (wait — this is InvestorKit, not APS)
- APS: team of buyer's agents + in-house renovation/construction project management team
- Sam Gordon personally: 84 individual title properties, 108 rentals, $48M+ portfolio
- Awards: REB BA of the Year 2024, Strategic Investor of Year 2020
- Summit events, community events, mentoring program (2025)
- "Mentor Clients" tier — more intensive support (Nathan & Katelyn case study)
