## The Business

**InvestorKit** is an investment-focused buyers' agency founded in 2018 by Arjun Paliwal.

- **Revenue trajectory:** $3.6M (22-23) → $7.6M (23-24) → $15M (24-25) → forecast $23–25M (25-26)
- **Staff:** 80+ full-time (InvestorKit Group)
- **Clients:** 1,200+ families
- **Awards:** REB Buyers Agency of the Year 2023 AND 2024 — only agency to win back-to-back
- **Media:** Forbes Australia Aug 2025; 1,000+ media articles; The Property Nerds podcast

Arjun's origin: Left CBA at 26 with 9 investment properties. Explicitly modelled IK on CBA's private banking team structure — not a boutique operator, a scaled specialist firm.

## What InvestorKit Actually Does

IK is a **full-service investment buyers' agency**. Clients pay for:

1. **Portfolio Assessment** — where you are now
2. **Property Brief Creation** — what you should buy and why
3. **Market Selection** — which cities/suburbs (data-driven)
4. **Property Sourcing** — finding, vetting, negotiating
5. **Ongoing Support** — check-ins, reviews, next cycle prep
6. **Post-Purchase Reviews** — annual reviews with Portfolio Strategist

They **do not** manage properties after purchase (not a property manager). They source, advise, and plan — then hand back to the client + their team (broker, accountant, PM).

## The Client Experience — End to End

### Entry
- Min ~$100k usable equity or funds
- Min residential purchase: $525k
- Min SMSF purchase: $575k
- Timeline to first purchase: 1–4 months (tighter brief = faster)
- They do SMSF and Trust purchases — sophisticated client base

### What They WON'T Buy (Hard Rules)
- New builds
- NDIS properties
- Units or apartments
- Knockdown rebuilds
- Major renovation properties
*This is a strict "established residential → commercial" bias. They are growth-first.*

### Active Markets
- 9–15 markets at any given time
- National, borderless — no geographic emotional bias
- 70% of deals sourced **offline** (not on listing portals)
- They reject 92% of properties reviewed — 8% pass their 20-point due diligence

### The Portfolio Mapping Session
The core product event. Every new client goes through this first.

What happens:
1. Understand financial goals, investment experience, risk profile
2. Build a "tailored brief" — target yield, capital growth, or cash flow balance
3. **Generate a portfolio plan** — forward-looking roadmap showing long-term impact
4. Collaborate with broker to validate borrowing capacity
5. Produce a "buyer brief" that drives acquisition

Output: A visual, modelled roadmap that projects:
- Portfolio value trajectory
- Passive income at target date (e.g. retirement)
- Inflation-adjusted projections
- Multi-property, multi-state view

Client quote: *"Using their portfolio plan with InvestorKit, they can see the long term impact. The properties alone are on track to support an inflation adjusted passive income target above $100,000 per year in retirement, before including super."*

### Ongoing Client Relationship
- **Annual reviews** with Portfolio Strategist (FAQ-confirmed baseline)
- Monthly check-ins possible for active acquisition clients (from job posting — not confirmed as standard)
- The Portfolio Strategist manages the client's journey between purchases
- CRM-tracked: tasks, notes, stage, upsell triggers

## The Team Structure (Private Banking Model)

Arjun deliberately replicated CBA's private banking structure:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Portfolio Strategist** | Strategy sessions, buyer briefs, client lifecycle management, annual reviews |
| **Research Team** | Suburb selection, market data, macro/micro analysis |
| **Acquisitions Team** | Property sourcing, negotiations, off-market network |
| **Client Success / Onboarding** | Post-purchase support, check-ins, handover |

Each client has **one point of contact** (Portfolio Strategist) but accesses a full team behind them.

## The Investment Framework

### Three-Stage Portfolio Framework

IK explicitly moves clients through three stages:

**Stage 1: Foundation**
- Major markets, larger price points
- Blue chip capital city assets
- Goal: Build a strong equity base in proven markets
- Example: Brisbane house, Sydney fringe, high-growth corridor

**Stage 2: Momentum**
- Affordable prices, spread nationally
- Data-driven city/suburb selection — any market if the data supports it
- Goal: Use Foundation equity to acquire more assets, accelerate growth
- Example: Regional cities, emerging markets, high-yield blends

**Stage 3: Passive**
- Commercial properties and unit blocks
- Cash flow-positive from day one
- Quote: *"Assets where you don't take one step back, two steps forward like in residential. You simply take a step forward as cash flow is present from day one and growth continues to accumulate in the remainder of the portfolio."*
- Goal: Transition from growth to income — financial independence

### Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate (Arjun's Lifecycle Framework)
From The Property Nerds podcast (confirmed June 2024 SPI article):

1. **Acquire** — buy the right property in the right market at the right time
2. **Optimise** — manage it, maximise yield, position equity for next move
3. **Consolidate** — review the whole portfolio, decide what to hold/sell, prepare next acquisition

This maps onto the Three Stages: Foundation + Momentum = Acquire cycle. Passive = Consolidate destination.

### Market Selection Philosophy
- Macro indicators: population growth, infrastructure, employment, supply/demand balance
- Micro: suburb vacancy rates, rental demand, comparable sales
- Counter-cyclical bias — buy ahead of the herd, not with it
- Hard data-first, emotion-last

## Client Case Studies — What the Journey Actually Looks Like

### Michael — 13 properties, $16.54M, $2.8M equity, 5 years, 5 states
The clearest example of the full three-stage journey at scale:
- Foundation → Momentum residential → transitioned to commercial Passive
- Treated IK "like a key advisor in his business"

### Raj & Sowji — 8 properties, $9M+, 4 states
- Explicitly named Foundation → Momentum → now transitioning to commercial Passive
- The case study that confirmed IK's three-stage language publicly
- Quote from IK on their journey through the stages

- Both physios in Darwin
- Brisbane house (2020): $485k → ~$1M (106%)
- Bundaberg (2022): $390k → $620k (59%)
- Ballarat (DIY, earlier): slow performer — contrast lesson
- Portfolio plan shows: on track for $100k+ inflation-adjusted passive income in retirement
- Key quote: *"They no longer feel like retirement is an open question. They know time is now working in their favour."*

### Nafiz — 5 properties, $2.86M, $900k+ equity, 5 years
- 26-year-old young professional living at home when he started
- First buy: Brisbane house, 2019 → now up 95.94%

- 4 states, growth + yield + diversification blend

### The "3 properties in 3 years" Benchmark
IK's headline claim: *"Most of our clients obtain 3 properties within 3 years."*
This places clients in the top 10% of Australian property investors by volume.

## What Kind of Client IK Attracts

Based on case studies:
- Professional couples (physios, business owners, engineers) — dual income, strong serviceability
- Young singles living at home — high savings rate, low overhead
- Established investors who've stalled (1-2 properties, want to accelerate)
- SMSF holders and trust structures (sophisticated, high net worth)
- All national — no geographic concentration required

Common denominator: **They want a system, not just a deal.** IK clients are buying into the framework (three stages, annual review, portfolio plan) — not just a single property recommendation.

---

## What IK Does NOT Offer (Gaps)

- No client-facing dashboard or portal
- No self-service scenario modelling for clients
- No automated equity tracking between purchases
- No milestone alerts ("your Brisbane property just hit X equity — time to review")
- Annual reviews are human-delivered (Portfolio Strategist time-intensive)
- No structured Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate tracking visible to clients
- Commercial roadmap is informal — not modelled in a visual tool

The portfolio plan is created in sessions (likely using Gameplans), but clients don't have their own live copy — it's a point-in-time document, not a living dashboard.
