# InvestorKit — Pure Deep Dive
*No PropPath lens. Just IK as a business, a service, and a client experience.*
*Research: Feb 2026*

## What InvestorKit Actually Is

InvestorKit is a **national buyers agency** that specialises in investment property. Not a tool. Not an education platform. A team of humans who find, evaluate, and negotiate property purchases on behalf of clients building long-term portfolios.

They've layered onto that core service:
- A proprietary research framework (data-first suburb selection)
- A structured client lifecycle (Portfolio Strategist model)
- A podcast content brand (The Property Nerds)
- A visual portfolio modelling layer (Gameplans, branded as Portfolio Wealth Accelerator)

## Business Model

- **Revenue:** ~$15M in 2024-25 (up from $7.6M prior year, $3.6M the year before — near doubling YoY)
- **Forecast:** $23–25M in 2025-26
- **Clients:** 1,200+ families served
- **Staff:** 80+ full-time across InvestorKit Group
- **Founded:** 2018 by Arjun Paliwal (ex-CBA, left at 26 with 9 properties)
- **Recognition:** REB Buyers Agency of the Year — 2023 AND 2024 (only agency to win consecutively)
- **Reviews:** 700+ five-star reviews
- **Media:** Forbes Australia Aug 2025, 1000+ media articles total

---

## How They Make Money

IK charges a **buyer's agent fee** per property purchase — typically a flat fee or % of purchase price. No public pricing on their site (leads must book a call). Based on industry norms, likely $8k–$15k per property for residential.

Their revenue doubling YoY suggests either:
- More clients (volume), or
- Expansion into higher-value commercial ($2M–$10M+) where fees scale accordingly
- Likely both

The commercial tier is explicitly part of their offer — minimum $2M–$10M+ purchase price.

## The Team Structure (Private Banking Model)

Arjun deliberately modelled IK on how CBA's private banking team worked — one point of contact for each client, but the client accesses a team of specialists behind that contact.

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Portfolio Strategist** | Client-facing relationship owner. Runs portfolio mapping sessions, monthly strategy reviews, buyer briefs, manages lifecycle |
| **Research Team** | Suburb selection, market data, proprietary modelling. Identifies markets BEFORE the curve |
| **Acquisitions Team** | Sourcing properties, negotiating, off-market deals (70% of deals are off-market) |
| **Client Success / Onboarding** | Post-purchase support, annual reviews |

The **Portfolio Strategist** is the highest-leverage role — they own the client relationship start to finish, from initial strategy session through to repeat purchases.

## What Clients Actually Go Through

### Entry Requirements
- Minimum usable equity or funds: ~$100k
- Minimum residential purchase: $525k
- Minimum SMSF purchase: $575k
- Minimum commercial: $2M–$10M+
- Timeline from brief to purchase: **1–4 months** (depends on how specific client is with their brief)
- SMSF purchases: Yes
- Trust purchases: Yes

### What They DON'T Buy (Hard Rules)
- New builds
- NDIS properties
- Units / apartments
- Knockdown rebuilds
- Major renovation properties

Only 8% of properties reviewed pass IK's due diligence.

### The Client Journey (Step by Step)

**1. Portfolio Assessment**
Initial session — understand the client's goals, financial position, investment experience, risk profile. This is where the Portfolio Strategist maps the current state vs target state.

**2. Property Brief Creation**
A written "buyer brief" — targets specific yield, capital growth, or cash flow balance. Validated with the client's broker for borrowing capacity. This is not a standard brief — it's tailored to the specific stage of the three-stage framework (see below).

**3. Market Selection**
Research team identifies which of the 9–15 active markets fits the brief. Macro (population, infrastructure, employment) + micro (suburb vacancy, comparable sales, rental demand).

**4. Property Sourcing**
Acquisitions team works the market — 70% off-market. Rejects 92% reviewed. Negotiates.

**5. Ongoing Support**
Post-purchase check-ins. Annual review with Portfolio Strategist. Equity assessment. Prep for next purchase.

**6. Post-Purchase Reviews**
Annual (confirmed in FAQ). Some clients get more frequent touchpoints during active growth phases.

## The Three-Stage Portfolio Framework

IK uses explicit stage language with clients. Confirmed from Raj & Sowji case study and Michael case study.

### Stage 1: Foundation
- Blue chip capital city assets
- Larger price points, major markets
- Focus: capital growth, strong fundamentals
- Purpose: build the equity base that funds the next stage

### Stage 2: Momentum
- Affordable entry points, spread nationally
- Data-driven location selection — any city, not just capitals
- Focus: use Foundation equity to acquire more at lower price points
- Purpose: accelerate portfolio size and diversification

### Stage 3: Passive
- Commercial properties and unit blocks
- Cash-flow positive from day one
- Key insight: *"Assets where you don't take one step back, two steps forward like in residential. You simply take a step forward as cash flow is present from day one and growth continues to accumulate."*
- Purpose: transition from growth to income — financial independence

### The Overarching Cycle: Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate
From The Property Nerds podcast (Arjun, June 2024):
- **Acquire** — find and buy the right property in the right market (at the right stage)
- **Optimise** — manage, refinance, maximise equity and yield between purchases
- **Consolidate** — review portfolio, decide what to hold/sell, prepare for next acquisition or stage transition

This is the macro lifecycle. The three stages (Foundation → Momentum → Passive) are WHERE you are. Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate is WHAT you do at each stage, repeatedly.

## The Portfolio Mapping Session — IK's Core Product

This is what IK ACTUALLY SELLS. Not just properties. A forward-looking portfolio plan.

### What happens:
1. Understand financial goals, investment experience, risk profile
2. Build a tailored brief — targets yield, capital growth, or cash flow balance
3. Generate a portfolio plan — forward-looking roadmap showing long-term impact
4. Collaborate with broker to validate borrowing capacity
5. Produce a buyer brief that drives acquisition

### What the Portfolio Plan projects:
- Portfolio value trajectory
- Passive income at target date (e.g. retirement)
- Inflation-adjusted projections
- Multi-property, multi-state view

This is where Gameplans (their visual modelling tool, branded as "Portfolio Wealth Accelerator") is used. The PWA was a campaign/content wrapper for Gameplans-powered sessions — NOT a standalone software product (page now redirects to homepage).

### Ongoing rhythm:
- Annual reviews (confirmed in FAQ as baseline)
- Monthly client review sessions (mentioned in Portfolio Strategist job description — may apply to active/high-velocity clients)
- Portfolio Strategist identifies upsell opportunities between purchases

## What IK Clients Experience Emotionally

From case studies and podcast content, the recurring emotional arc:

1. **Confusion/Overwhelm** — too many suburbs, too much conflicting advice, don't know where to start
2. **First purchase relief** — "I've finally done it, I'm on the board"
3. **Impatience** — waiting for equity to build, wanting to buy again
4. **Milestone clarity** — "I can see the plan now, I know what next looks like"
5. **Confidence** — repeat purchases feel easier, trust in the process
6. **Peace of mind** — knowing they're on track for retirement, not just hoping

The Ryan & Lauren quote captures the IK end-state promise perfectly:
> *"They no longer feel like retirement is an open question. They know time is now working in their favour."*
