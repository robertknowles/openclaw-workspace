## 1. Manufacturing Equity

**The concept:** Don't wait for the market to grow your equity — create it immediately through value-add.

### A. Cosmetic Renovation
- Target: Properties that are structurally sound but cosmetically dated
- Typical spend: $20–60k
- Target gain: $60–120k in value (2–3× return on reno cost)
- Focus areas: Kitchen, bathrooms, flooring, paint, facade
- Risk: Over-capitalising (spending more than you add)
- Key rule: What the market wants, not what you want

### B. Subdivision
- Split one large block into two or more titles
- Each title can be sold or developed separately
- Example: Buy 800sqm block, subdivide into two 400sqm lots
- Profit: Value of two smaller lots > value of original block + subdivision costs
- Requires: Council approval, surveyor, title search
- Timeframe: 6–24 months depending on council
- Best in: Suburbs with large older blocks near transport/amenity

### C. Dual Occupancy (Dual Occ)
- Build a second dwelling on the same block
- Can be: Granny flat, knockdown-rebuild duplex, converted garage
- Benefits: Two rental incomes from one land title, or sell one to release equity
- Strategy: Buy house + land, build second dwelling behind/beside, revalue at combined value
- After subdivision: Sell one dwelling, keep the other (recycle capital)
- *Source: councilapproval.com.au — "selling one unit releases equity while maintaining income from the first"*

### D. Development (Small-Scale)
- Knockdown-rebuild → sell 2–4 townhouses
- Requires: DA approval, builder, construction finance
- Higher risk, higher return
- Typically for experienced investors or with BA/developer partner
- Returns: 15–25%+ on total project cost if executed well

## 2. Market Cycle Timing

**The 4-Phase Property Cycle:**
*Source: MoneyQuest (Dec 2024) — moneyquest.com.au*

### Phase 1: Upturn (BUY)
- Prices starting to rise from the bottom
- Sentiment turning but not yet positive
- Media still reporting doom
- Smart money is buying
- Yields are at their highest relative to prices
- **Best time to buy** — requires conviction

### Phase 2: Boom (HOLD / SELECTIVE BUY)
- Strong price growth, media coverage, FOMO
- Every buyer is confident
- Yields compress as prices outrun rents
- Competition at auctions is fierce
- Late-cycle buyers overpay
- **Good time to manufacture equity and refinance**

### Phase 3: Downturn (HOLD / ACCUMULATE CASH)
- Prices plateau or fall slightly
- Negative sentiment, fewer transactions
- Opportunities appear for patient buyers
- Vendors more willing to negotiate
- **Hold existing assets; start identifying next buy opportunities**

### Phase 4: Stabilisation (BUY CAREFULLY)
- Bottom of market, low volumes
- Quality properties available below peak prices
- The "nobody wants to buy" phase
- **Serious long-term investors accumulate here**

**Key insight from searchproperty.com.au:**
The 18.6-year cycle theory is often cited but imperfect for Australia. Different cities are at **different cycle phases simultaneously** — when Sydney is booming, Brisbane might be stabilising, Perth might be at bottom. This is why diversification across cities is a valid strategy.

**PropPath implication:** Showing where each city sits on the market cycle, alongside where a client's property sits, helps the BA advise on WHEN to buy the next property and WHERE.

## 3. Negative Gearing as a Tool (Not a Trap)

Negative gearing gets a bad reputation but for high-income earners it can be strategic:

**How it works:**
- Property costs $5,000/year more to hold than you receive in rent
- That $5,000 loss reduces your taxable income
- At 47% tax rate → ATO subsidises $2,350 of your holding cost
- You're only "paying" $2,650/year net to hold an appreciating asset

**When it makes sense:**
- High income (37%+ tax bracket)
- Strong capital growth expected (growth will far exceed holding costs)
- Holding for 7–10+ years (time in market compounds the advantage)

**When it doesn't make sense:**
- Lower income (less tax benefit)
- Near retirement (need income not losses)
- Property in flat/declining market

## 4. Property Trusts and Structures

### Discretionary (Family) Trust
- Property held by trust, not individual
- Trustee distributes income to family members at low tax rates
- Can split rental income across spouse/adult children
- **Problem:** Banks assess trusts differently — often harder to get loans in trusts
- **Problem:** No CGT 50% discount available to trusts (individual does get it)
- Best for: High-income families with multiple earners at different tax rates

### SMSF (Self Managed Super Fund)
- Buy property inside super
- Super fund pays 15% tax on income (not your personal rate)
- On capital gains if held 12 months: effective 10% CGT rate
- **Problem:** Cannot buy property from related parties, cannot live in it
- **Problem:** Leverage limited (max 80% LVR, no cross-collateralisation)
- Best for: Investors close to retirement wanting to lock in low-tax growth

### Company Structure
- Flat 30% company tax rate (25% for base rate entities)
- No CGT 50% discount
- Rarely used for property — generally less tax-efficient than individuals for long-term holds

**PropPath implication:** Clients often hold different properties in different structures. PropPath should ideally track property across all structures in one portfolio view.

## 5. Commercial Property

High-yield, different risk profile. Typically added in portfolio consolidation phase.

### Key Differences from Residential
| | Residential | Commercial |
|-|-------------|------------|
| Typical yield | 3–5% | 5–10%+ |
| Lease length | 6–12 months | 3–10 years |
| Vacancy risk | Low | Higher |
| Tenant quality | Variable | Business (stable but can fail) |
| Outgoings | Landlord pays most | Tenant pays most (net lease) |
| Entry price | $300k–$2M+ | $200k–$5M+ |
| LVR banks allow | Up to 80% | Often only 65–70% |

### Types of Commercial
- Retail (shops) — good locations, tenant-dependent
- Office — COVID impact on demand, location critical
- Industrial (warehouses/storage) — strongest performer 2020–2025, e-commerce driven
- Medical/childcare — long leases, government-supported tenants, highly sought after

**Best for portfolio:** Medical, childcare, industrial — long leases, reliable tenants, strong yields

## 6. Key Concepts for PropPath Product Design

| Advanced Strategy | What PropPath Should Show |
|---|---|
| Manufacturing equity | Track before/after value on reno; project equity unlock timeline |
| Market cycle timing | City-level cycle indicator on portfolio map |
| Negative gearing | Net cash flow after tax per property |
| Serviceability ceiling | "You can afford X more properties at your current income" |
| Trust/structure | Property cards grouped by structure/ownership entity |
| Commercial vs residential | Portfolio composition chart: % growth vs % yield |
| The "exit" plan | Consolidation timeline: which properties to sell, when |
