## 1. The 5-Phase Portfolio Journey (Pivot Property Buyers Model)

This is the canonical framework for how Australian BAs think about portfolio building. **PropPath should visualise exactly this journey.**

| Phase | Name | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| 1 | **Accumulation** | Buy blue-chip properties. Focus: suburb selection, top 2% asset selection |
| 2 | **Expedite** | Manufacture equity via renovations/development. Increase yields. |
| 3 | **Maturation** | Hold. Let market work. LVR decreases over time. |
| 4 | **Consolidation** | Sell down residential. Reinvest into commercial cash-flow assets. |
| 5 | **Debt Reduction** | Build passive income portfolio. Achieve financial freedom. |

## 2. The Equity Leverage Mechanism

The engine that drives portfolio growth:

1. Buy property
2. Value grows (capital growth)
3. Refinance at 80% LVR
4. Extract equity
5. Use extracted equity as deposit for next property
6. Repeat

**Critical constraint:** Each property must be cash flow positive (or at least serviceable) to sustain the chain.
**Alternative:** If equity is large enough, purchase next property outright in cash.

## 3. Australian Property Fundamentals

### Market Characteristics
- **Sydney/Melbourne:** High prices, steady capital growth, highly competitive
- **Regional:** Higher rental yields, lower entry prices, slower capital growth
- **Key investor decision:** Capital growth vs. yield (rarely both in same market)

### Key Metrics BAs and Clients Track
- Rental yield (gross and net)
- Capital growth rate (historical and projected)
- Cash flow (weekly/monthly surplus or deficit)
- LVR (Loan-to-Value Ratio)
- Vacancy rates
- Borrowing capacity

### Tax Considerations
- **Negative gearing:** Property expenses exceed rental income; loss offsets other income
- **Capital Gains Tax (CGT):** 50% CGT discount if held 12+ months
- **Depreciation:** Non-cash deduction on building and fixtures (requires QS report)

### Core Strategies
- **Buy-to-hold:** Long-term capital growth play
- **Buy-to-sell (flip):** Short-term equity manufacture
- **BRRRR (Buy, Renovate, Rent, Refinance, Repeat):** Common equity acceleration strategy

## 4. How Leading BAs Structure Their Process

### InvestorKit (AU's #1 BA — 2023 & 2024)
**Key product:** "Portfolio Mapping Session"
- Average client result: 3 properties in 3 years
- 5-step process:
  1. **Discovery** — understand client goals, financial position
  2. **Comprehensive Assessment** — borrowing capacity, existing assets, risk profile
  3. **Tailored Strategy** — personalised roadmap
  4. **Acquisition** — property sourcing and purchase
  5. **Post-settlement support** — ongoing portfolio reviews

### Pivot Property Buyers — Portfolio Planner
Explicitly maps for clients:
- Number of properties needed to hit goal
- Cash contributions required at each stage
- Equity projections over time
- Expected yields per property

**→ This is essentially what PropPath does. We do it visually.**

## 5. PropPath Strategic Positioning

**The gap in the market:**
All current tools handle **sourcing** (finding properties) or **analysis** (suburb data).
**Nobody visualises the ongoing portfolio journey** — the roadmap from where client is now to financial freedom.

**PropPath sits above the entire stack:**
- Open BA → sourcing platform
- HTAG Analytics → suburb data
- SystemsDU / BA-ICON → CRM
- **PropPath → the portfolio roadmap layer that lives above all of these**

## Open Research Questions
- What does the actual OUTPUT of a BA portfolio planning session look like? (PDF? Spreadsheet? Verbal?)
- What's the typical client profile? (income, savings, timeline, goal property count)
- How does borrowing capacity change over a multi-property journey?
- Does PropPath need integration with mortgage broker tools?
- What triggers a client to move from Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3?
