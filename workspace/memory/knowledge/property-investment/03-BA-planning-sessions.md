*Created: Session 2 | Research: Feb 2026*

## KEY FINDING: Gameplans is a Direct Competitor ⚠️

**gameplans.com.au** — This is the closest existing product to PropPath.

### What Gameplans Does
- Real-time visual property portfolio modelling tool for buyers agents
- Clients input their full financial picture → BAs model multiple futures
- Side-by-side scenario comparison: residential vs commercial, 2 properties vs 1, different growth rates
- Shows 30-year wealth trajectories
- **Killer feature:** Alerts the BA the moment a client has enough equity to buy again ("Sarah has enough equity for her next purchase")
- White-labelled — BA presents it as their own tool
- BAs charge $2K-$5K+ per strategy session using Gameplans

### Who Uses Gameplans (confirmed clients on their site)
- InvestorKit (AU's #1 BA 2023/2024) — Arjun Paliwal
- Henderson Advocacy — Jack Henderson
- Property Principals — Joe Tucker
- Your Empire — Chris Gray
- Metropole Property Strategists — Michael Yardney
- Palise Property
- Mecca Property Group
- Property Planning Australia
- Actuate Property

### Gameplans Positioning
*"Spreadsheets confuse clients. GamePlans converts them."*
*"Strategic planning sessions that show clients their complete property roadmap."*

### What This Means for PropPath
Gameplans is a **direct competitor** in the BA planning session space. However:
- Gameplans appears to be primarily a **session tool** (used live with the client)
- PropPath is positioned as an **ongoing portfolio roadmap** (the client's living plan between sessions)
- PropPath should offer what Gameplans doesn't: a client-facing portal, ongoing tracking, and the full journey visualisation (not just the next purchase)

## How BAs Structure Portfolio Planning Sessions

### Standard Session Structure

**Pre-session (client intake):**
- Full financial picture: income, assets, liabilities, existing properties, borrowing capacity
- Goals: number of properties target, passive income goal, timeline
- Risk profile: conservative/balanced/aggressive

**During session:**
- Current position → Gap analysis (where are they now vs. where they want to be)
- Borrowing capacity assessment (current and projected)
- Portfolio strategy selection (growth-focused, yield-focused, hybrid)
- Property roadmap: which property first, where, what type, when
- Scenario modelling: "what if" comparisons
- Equity projection: when can they buy property #2, #3, etc.

**Session output (what clients receive):**
- Property roadmap document (number of properties, timeline, rough targets)
- Equity projections (how equity grows over time per property)
- Cash flow projections (rental income vs. holding costs over time)
- Borrowing capacity projections (year by year)
- Strategy recommendation (buy-and-hold, BRRRR, rentvesting, etc.)

### Purpose Property (Luke Wiles — Brisbane BA + Chartered Accountant)
- **"Portfolio Plan" sessions** — one-off 1:1 strategy sessions
- Sold as standalone product ($X per session) to people NOT wanting full BA services
- Focus: creating a roadmap for the future
- Client completes pre-session questionnaire first
- Combines property strategy with tax/accounting view (unique given CA background)

## The Portfolio Roadmap — What It Actually Contains

Based on research, a typical BA portfolio roadmap includes:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Current position** | Existing assets, liabilities, equity, borrowing capacity |
| **Target** | # properties, passive income goal, timeline (e.g. "5 properties in 10 years") |
| **Property #1 plan** | Location, price range, type, expected yield, expected growth rate |
| **Equity projection** | When is equity available for Property #2? |
| **Property #2 plan** | Same as above, conditional on Property #1 performing |
| **Cash flow summary** | Portfolio-level weekly/monthly cash flow at each stage |
| **Borrowing capacity** | Year-by-year borrowing capacity as portfolio grows |
| **Risk flags** | What breaks the plan (rate rises, vacancy, no growth) |
| **Next action** | Immediate next step (often: "go see mortgage broker") |

## What Makes a Great Planning Session (BA Perspective)

From Gameplans testimonials:
- *"Gives clients the ability to reverse engineer their end goal, then show them a path on how they're going to get there"* — Jack Henderson
- *"Far more powerful and practical than spreadsheets, gives clients clarity and confidence"* — Chris Gray
- *"So simple, yet handles complex scenarios"* — Arjun Paliwal

**Client psychology:** Clients don't want data. They want to SEE their future. Visual = confidence = purchase decision.

## PropPath Product Implications

### What PropPath should do better than Gameplans:
1. **Ongoing living roadmap** — not just a session tool. Client can log in anytime and see their roadmap.
2. **Client-facing portal** — Gameplans appears BA-only. PropPath gives clients their own view.
3. **Milestone tracking** — as properties are purchased, the plan updates in real-time.
4. **Equity trigger alerts** — replicate Gameplans' "Sarah has enough equity" feature.
5. **Simpler onboarding** — BA can set up a client plan in minutes, not hours.
6. **BA → Client relationship tool** — keeps BA top of mind between purchases (not just at session time).

### PropPath's Unique Position vs Gameplans:
- Gameplans = **the session** (live, one-time, BA-facing)
- PropPath = **the ongoing relationship** (persistent, client-facing, living plan)

These could be complementary — a BA uses Gameplans for the session, then hands client a PropPath link for ongoing tracking. OR PropPath replaces Gameplans entirely by doing both.
