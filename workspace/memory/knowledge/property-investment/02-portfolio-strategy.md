## The Core Mechanic: The Equity Ladder

The fundamental strategy used by every serious Australian property investor:

```
Buy Property 1 → Growth occurs → Extract equity → Use as deposit for Property 2
→ Growth on both → Extract equity → Deposit for Property 3
→ Repeat until serviceability wall or goal achieved
```

**The key insight:** You never "run out" of deposit money if you buy growth assets. The portfolio funds itself.

## The 5-Phase Portfolio Journey (Pivot Property Buyers Framework)

### Phase 1: Accumulation — Building the Asset Base
- Focus: Buying quality growth properties
- Criteria: Blue-chip suburbs with proven capital growth track records
- Strategy: Target top 2% of properties in a chosen area
- Key metrics: Strong historical growth, socio-economic stability, rental demand
- Tools: Suburb heatmaps, supply/demand ratios, building approval data
- Timeline: First 5–15 years

### Phase 2: Expedite — Manufacturing Equity
- Focus: Accelerating equity growth beyond market growth
- Methods: Strategic renovations, value-add projects, development
- Goal: Unlock equity faster than waiting for market appreciation
- Example: Buy at $500k, spend $60k on reno, property revalues at $620k → $60k manufactured equity
- Key: Cost-effective renovations aligned with market demand (kitchens, bathrooms, facades)

### Phase 3: Maturation — Let the Market Work
- Focus: Hold, wait, compound
- LVR naturally decreases as values rise
- No active buying required
- Patience is the strategy
- Time horizon: 10–20 years

### Phase 4: Consolidation — Optimise the Portfolio
- Focus: Reduce debt, release capital
- Action: Selectively sell underperforming residential properties
- Reinvest proceeds into: high-yielding commercial assets
- Goal: Shift from growth-oriented to income-generating portfolio

### Phase 5: Debt Reduction — Cash Flow Freedom
- Focus: Financial independence
- Portfolio now: Lower risk, higher yields, consistent monthly cash flow
- Commercial properties with 6–8%+ yield producing passive income
- Passive income > living expenses = **financial freedom**

## The Equity Extraction Mechanic (How It Actually Works)

### Step 1: Wait for Growth
Property bought at $500k grows to $700k (40% growth, ~5 years at 7% p.a.)

### Step 2: Calculate Usable Equity
- Property value: $700k
- 80% of value: $560k (bank's lending limit)
- Current loan: $400k
- **Usable equity = $560k - $400k = $160k**

### Step 3: Access the Equity
Two methods:
- **Refinance:** New lender pays out old loan + gives you access to the equity
- **Home equity loan / line of credit:** Borrow against existing property, keep same lender

### Step 4: Use as Deposit
$160k usable equity → can use as 20% deposit on a $800k property (no LMI)

### Step 5: Repeat
New property grows. Extract equity. Buy next property.

## Debt Recycling

**What it is:** Converting non-deductible debt (home loan) into tax-deductible investment debt.

**How it works:**
1. Make extra repayments on your PPOR mortgage (reduces non-deductible debt)
2. Redraw or refinance that equity to invest in income-producing assets (investment property or shares)
3. Interest on the investment loan is now tax-deductible
4. Investment income helps pay down PPOR mortgage faster
5. Cycle the equity again into more investment assets

**Result:** Accelerates PPOR paydown + builds investment portfolio simultaneously + maximises tax efficiency

**Example:**
- PPOR mortgage: $600k @ 6% = $36k/yr non-deductible interest
- Pay $50k extra → redraw $50k → invest in property
- $50k investment loan interest IS deductible
- Repeat every time equity builds up

**Risk:** Leveraged investment means losses if property falls. Not a set-and-forget strategy.

## Serviceability: The Real Wall

Most investors don't hit an equity wall — they hit a **serviceability wall**.

Banks assess loans at a 3% buffer above the offered rate. At current rates (~6.5%), that's ~9.5% assessment rate.

**Common pattern:**
- Investor buys 2–3 properties
- Portfolio is positively geared or near neutral
- But bank still won't lend more because income can't service the total debt at buffer rate
- Solution: Stop, let rents rise (time), increase income, use different lender structure (e.g., one property in trust, one personal, use different banks)

**Why this matters for PropPath:**
- PropPath should model serviceability limits, not just equity
- Show clients: "At your current income, you can buy up to X properties before hitting your borrowing limit"
- This is the #1 thing BAs need to communicate to clients — and nothing visualises it today

## The Cash Flow vs Capital Growth Trade-off

Serious investors eventually need BOTH. The sequencing matters:

**Common strategy:**
1. Early phase → buy capital growth assets (negative or neutral gearing, major cities)
2. Build equity base
3. Mid phase → add higher-yield assets (regional or commercial) to improve serviceability
4. Late phase → sell/consolidate, acquire cash-flow-positive commercial

**The balancing act:**
- Too much capital growth focus → serviceability wall hit fast
- Too much yield focus → equity grows slowly, portfolio takes longer to build
- Best portfolios blend both: growth assets (2/3) + yield assets (1/3)

## How BAs Structure the Portfolio Planning Conversation

Based on research from InvestorKit, Pivot, GetRAR:

**Step 1: Discovery**
- Client goals: retirement age, target income, risk tolerance
- Current position: PPOR equity, savings, income, existing debt

**Step 2: Portfolio Mapping / Strategy Session**
- How many properties needed to hit goal?
- What order to buy them?
- Which cities/suburbs at each stage?
- What's the cash flow at each stage?

**Step 3: Property #1 Acquisition**
- Execute purchase based on strategy

**Step 4: Monitoring**
- Track equity growth
- Track cash flow
- Identify when to extract equity for next purchase

**Step 5: Property #2, #3... **
- Repeat with updated strategy based on current portfolio position

## The "3 Properties in 3 Years" Pattern

InvestorKit's stated outcome for most clients: **3 properties in 3 years**.

This only works if:
- First property bought well (high-growth suburb, strong fundamentals)
- Growth comes quickly (or equity manufactured via reno)
- Serviceability maintained through property selection (not all negatively geared)

**This is the exact journey PropPath should visualise.** Each property purchase is a milestone on the map.

## PropPath Relevance

The portfolio strategy layer is where PropPath lives:

| What BAs Do Today | What PropPath Should Show |
|---|---|
| Spreadsheet with equity projections | Visual timeline of equity growth per property |
| Mental model of "next purchase" timing | "Your equity unlocks Property 2 in ~18 months" |
| Rough cash flow estimates | Live cash flow dashboard across all properties |
| Strategy session doc (one-off) | Ongoing living roadmap that updates as market moves |
| Client forgets the plan | Client can log in and see where they are on the journey |

**The visual portfolio roadmap is the product.** Not a spreadsheet. Not a report. A living map of a client's wealth journey.
