## Core Philosophy & Mental Models

### 1. Reverse-Engineering Goals
- Start with the end income goal (e.g. $100k passive income/year)
- Reverse engineer: how many properties at what yield get you there?
  - Example: 4 properties × $25k yield each = $100k/yr
- Then work backwards: what's your timeframe? What's your current borrowing capacity? How fast can you accumulate?

### 2. "Acting Rich vs Being Wealthy"
- Short-term sacrifice = long-term freedom
- Sam's mantra: "A few years of sacrifice can set you up for a lifetime of financial freedom"
- Classic mistake: leasing expensive cars, luxury spending → kills borrowing capacity
- Client story: sold a depreciating ute, bought 3 properties in 12 months, $500k equity in one year
- Sam himself: drove an old Land Rover, spent holidays doing renovations for 7 years

### 3. Property as a Business
- Treat investing as a business, not a hobby
- Maintain low LVRs (loan-to-value ratios) to sustain portfolio expansion
- Leverage equity intelligently — don't just wait, manufacture it where possible

### 4. "You Can't Pay Rent With Fish"
- Repeated phrase: take action, don't overthink
- 92% of Australians never own more than 1–2 investment properties
- Mindset + network + community are the differentiators

### 5. "You Can Never Out-Save a Good Market"
- Capital growth outpaces savings rates
- Getting into the market and in the right market matters more than timing perfectly
- Get in, leverage growth, recycle into next purchase

## The Three Deal Types (APS Framework)

APS categorises deals into three types — this is the core of their strategy framework:

### Type 1: Bread & Butter (B&B) Deals
- **Core concept:** Solid growth asset in a proven location, bought below market value
- Formula: **Solid Growth Location + Below Market Value Purchase**
- These are the backbone of portfolio building — reliable, scalable
- Not flashy, not high yield — but steady capital growth + manufactured equity on entry
- APS team uses networks/off-market connections to find these
- Key metric: can you buy it at a discount? How much equity do you manufacture on purchase?
- Sam's quote: "Some buyers' agents claim buying below market value is a myth. It's not. It just requires experience and connections."

### Type 2: Manufactured Cash Flow Deals
- Higher yield properties in regional/growth markets
- Goal: positive or neutral cash flow to improve serviceability for next purchase
- Often involves: granny flats, dual income properties, commercial residential hybrids
- Solving the serviceability problem: each cash flow deal makes it easier to borrow again
- These are what allow you to buy 3 properties off one deposit — cash flow from property 1 & 2 supports serviceability for property 3

### Type 3: Manufactured Equity (via Renovation/Construction)
- Buy underperforming property, add value through strategic renovation
- Unlock equity quickly to fund next purchase without saving a new deposit
- APS has an in-house renovations/construction project management team
- Key: don't over-capitalise — renovate for value, not for taste

## The "3 Properties Off 1 Deposit" Scenario

This is APS's signature repeatable outcome — and a powerful concept for PropPath:

**How it works:**
1. Save one deposit (say $50–80k)
2. Buy Property 1 — ideally B&B deal with some below-market equity, moderate to good yield
3. Property 1's rental income + any manufactured equity (reno or instant below-market) = **improved serviceability + usable equity**
4. Use equity from Property 1 to fund deposit for Property 2 (cross-collateralise or equity release via broker)
5. Property 2 = cash flow focused → further improves serviceability
6. Now serviceable enough for Property 3 — can be a growth asset
7. Result: 3 properties in 12 months, from one initial deposit

**Real client example (Liam, $65k income):**
- Started: $55k deposit, $65k income
- Result: 3 properties in 2.5 years
- Total portfolio cost: $695,000
- Total portfolio value: $1,120,000
- Net equity: $425,000
- Overall yield: 7.9%

**Real client example (Luke):**
- 4 properties in <2 years, across 3 states
- Portfolio cost: $1,140,000
- Portfolio value: $1,680,000
- Net equity: $540,000
- Yield: 7.7%

**Real client example (Tim & Katie):**
- First deal: $410k purchase
- Market value immediately: $450k+
- Instant equity: $40k+
- Rental return: $510/week (6.5% yield)

**Real client example (Ella):**
- First property at 21, 5-property portfolio by 24

**Real client example (Nathan & Katelyn, 2025):**
- 5 properties in 12 months
- Portfolio worth $2.5 million

## Key Strategic Concepts

### Serviceability Management
- **The core challenge:** Banks don't just look at deposits — they look at income vs total debt obligations
- As portfolio grows, serviceability gets tighter (each new mortgage adds to assessed liabilities)
- APS solution: **interleave cash flow deals with growth deals** — the cash flow deals offset the serviceability drag
- Working with specialist investment brokers is essential (not just any bank)
- "Dealing with lenders stalling his journey, serviceability caps" — this is a real obstacle APS clients navigate
- Low LVR discipline helps maintain borrowing capacity over time

### Market Selection for Growth
- APS invests across multiple states (not just local market)
- Look for: supply/demand imbalance, infrastructure spending, population growth, job creation
- Don't just buy in your backyard (Sydney, Melbourne = often too expensive to get yield)
- Understanding data: median prices, vacancy rates, days on market, auction clearance rates
- Episode: "How To Pick A Growth Market & Understanding Data"

### Geographic Diversification
- Spread across 3+ states = reduces concentration risk
- Different market cycles → one state growing while another flat
- Episode chapter: "Diversification: When to Buy Across States?"

### Buying Below Market Value
- APS's differentiator — off-market connections, strong negotiation
- Manufactured equity on day 1 = instant safety margin
- Not a myth — requires networks and experience
- Chapter: "Buying Below Market Value: What Does It Mean?"

### Sell vs Hold
- General APS philosophy: **hold long-term** — "you can never out-save a good market"
- Only sell if: property fundamentally underperforming AND capital could be better deployed
- Selling triggers CGT — usually a last resort
- Episode: "Sell vs Hold: Decision Making When a Property Is Stagnant"

### Underperforming Assets — Assessment
- Regular portfolio review: is each property pulling its weight?
- Assess: capital growth (what has it done?), cash flow (is it neutral/positive?), location outlook (still strong?)
- Episode: "Assessing Underperforming Properties"

### SMSF Investing
- APS clients increasingly using SMSF for property
- Covered in Q&A episode: "SMSF Strategies"
- Adds complexity but tax benefits at retirement phase

### Depreciation
- Episode chapter: "Depreciation: Should You Target Newer Builds?"
- Newer builds have higher depreciation schedules → better tax offset
- Trade-off: new builds often have less manufacturing opportunity (already priced at market)

### Blue Collar vs Blue Chip
- Episode: "Blue Collar vs Blue Chip: Personal Residence Strategy"
- APS clients often start with investment-grade properties before premium personal residence
- Blue collar = reliable yield, affordable, often regional
- Blue chip = high capital growth, low yield, expensive entry

### Mindset Scaling: 1–2 Properties to 5–10
- The shift from "accidental landlord" to "strategic investor"
- Episode: "Mindset Shifts: Scaling from 1–2 to 5–10 Properties"
- Requires: portfolio plan, broker relationship, accountant structure, trust in process

## Is Cash Flow Dead? (Major Debate)

APS devoted a full episode to this. Key takeaways:
- In 2023–2025, rising interest rates squeezed cash flow significantly
- High-yield deals harder to find in capital cities → must look regionally
- But: **cash flow is not dead** — it has moved, not disappeared
- Regional QLD, SA, WA, parts of NT: still positive cash flow deals available
- APS position: cash flow + growth balance is the goal, not pure cash flow chasing
- "You can't just chase yield without growth — you get stuck"
- "Bread and butter" is now the safer path for most; cash flow is the unlock for serviceability

## PropPath Relevance — What APS Tells Us

### What APS clients need (and what PropPath could visualise):
1. **The portfolio roadmap** — reverse engineered from income goal → number of properties → timeline
2. **Deal type sequencing** — B&B first, then cash flow, then growth → which order for YOUR situation?
3. **Serviceability tracking** — after each purchase, what's my remaining borrowing capacity?
4. **Equity position over time** — live tracking of manufactured + organic equity
5. **Milestone events** — "you now have enough equity to buy Property 2" (like Gameplans equity trigger alerts)
6. **State diversification map** — visualise spread across states
7. **Cash flow vs growth balance** — at a portfolio level, not just per property
8. **Goal progress** — am I on track to hit $100k passive income by 2030?

### What APS's process lacks (PropPath opportunity):
- No client-facing ongoing dashboard — sessions are point-in-time
- No living portfolio roadmap between sessions
- No automated equity trigger notifications
- No visualisation of "what if I add property X — how does it change my position?"
