## The InvestorKit Service Model

### Internal Team Structure (Private Banking Model)
Borrowed from CBA's private banking segmentation:
- Portfolio Strategist (strategy + client relationships)
- Research Analyst (market data + suburb selection)
- Acquisition Agent (negotiation + purchase)
- Client Success / Onboarding
- Broker + Conveyancer network (external, coordinated)
- Each client gets a dedicated team — not one-stop-shop individual

### Service Process (5 Steps)
1. **Free 15-min discovery call** — fit assessment
2. **Comprehensive Assessment** — financial goals, investment experience, risk profile
3. **Portfolio Mapping Session + Strategy** — CRITICAL (see below)
4. **Seamless Acquisition** — find, negotiate, purchase
5. **Post-Settlement Support** — ongoing reviews, next purchase planning

## THE KEY PRODUCT: Portfolio Mapping Session ⭐

This is the closest comparable to PropPath. Everything below is sourced directly.

### What It Is (from job listing for Portfolio Strategist role):
> "Conduct high-quality portfolio mapping sessions tailored to each client's goals and investment profile."
> "Collaborate with brokers and acquisitions teams to generate accurate, actionable buyer briefs."
> "Provide timely and ongoing strategic guidance to existing clients to support repeat purchases."
> "Lead monthly client review sessions and maintain engagement throughout the lifecycle."

### What Happens In It:
- Deep dive into current financial position (income, savings, existing properties, borrowing capacity)
- Goal-setting: passive income target, timeline, risk tolerance
- Build a tailored **portfolio plan** — a long-term roadmap showing path to goal
- Plan shows: which properties to buy, in what sequence, and projected long-term income
- Used as reference during ongoing engagement and repeat purchases

### From the $4.5M Case Study (Ryan & Lauren):
> "Using their portfolio plan with InvestorKit, they can see the long term impact. The properties alone are on track to support an inflation adjusted passive income target above $100,000 per year in retirement, before including super."

This is the **living portfolio plan** — it spans the full journey, not just one purchase.

### Portfolio Wealth Accelerator
- A tool/product InvestorKit built (or licences — likely Gameplans)
- Quote: "This mapping technology enables me to continuously monitor the performance of my portfolio and make informed decisions based on valuable insights."
- Quote: "Clients of InvestorKit have also benefited from utilising this tool during their journey with our Buyer's Agents to enhance their investment strategies."
- **This is their internal tool** — used by BAs with clients, not a client-facing portal
- Strongly suggested this IS Gameplans (InvestorKit is listed as a Gameplans client in prior research)

## InvestorKit's Core Investment Framework

### The Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate Cycle
From The Property Nerds podcast:
1. **Acquire** — find and purchase next property in sequence
2. **Optimise** — maximise performance of existing portfolio (refinancing, property management, rent reviews)
3. **Consolidate** — review position, assess borrowing capacity, prepare for next cycle

This is the **strategic cycle** that repeats. PropPath should visualise this.

### Four Criteria for a Good Investment:
1. **Right Property for You** — matches risk tolerance, strategy, goals
2. **In the Right Market** — growth cycle or about to enter one (data-driven market selection)
3. **At the Right Price** — due diligence on comparables, yield, risk
4. **Passes All Due Diligence** — legal, rental demand, building, red flags

### Portfolio Strategy Approach:
- Long-term hold bias — "let the market do the heavy lifting"
- Multi-state diversification (standard for IK clients: 3+ states)
- Mix of high-growth and yield assets
- Annual reviews built into client engagement
- Residential AND commercial property (they do both)
- 20-point due diligence checklist on every deal

### Ryan & Lauren (2 physios, Darwin):

## Critical Insight for PropPath

InvestorKit explicitly promises a **"portfolio plan"** that clients can reference throughout their journey — showing long-term income projections, property sequencing, and retirement outcomes. BUT:

1. This plan is **BA-controlled** — the strategist holds it, presents it in sessions
2. Clients reference it **through conversations with their BA**, not a client-facing tool
3. The "Portfolio Wealth Accelerator" / Gameplans tool is **BA-facing only**
4. There is **no client portal** where the investor can log in and see their roadmap

**PropPath fills this gap:** The client gets their own living roadmap. They can see it anytime. It updates as properties are added. It shows them their progress toward their $100K passive income goal. The BA uses it WITH the client — not just for the BA.

---

## InvestorKit Portfolio Strategist Role (What They Do Day-to-Day)
This tells us exactly what PropPath needs to support:
- Portfolio mapping sessions (initial strategy)
- Buyer briefs (what to buy next, aligned to plan)
- CRM tracking (notes, stages, milestones)
- Monthly client review sessions
- Upsell identification (when client is ready to buy again)
- Managing clients through property rejections (confidence maintenance)
- Ongoing strategic guidance between purchases

**Every one of these is a PropPath feature opportunity.**

## PropPath Positioning vs InvestorKit

InvestorKit sells the BA service. PropPath is the tool that makes the BA look more professional, retain clients longer, and scale more sessions. InvestorKit would be a **target customer** for PropPath, not a competitor.

Their Portfolio Mapping Session = PropPath's portfolio roadmap builder.
Their monthly reviews = PropPath's ongoing dashboard.
Their buyer briefs = PropPath's "next purchase" recommendation module.
