## 1. Debt Recycling

**What it is:** Converting non-deductible home loan debt into tax-deductible investment debt.

**How it works:**
1. Make extra repayments on home mortgage (reduces non-deductible debt)
2. Redraw or refinance that equity
3. Invest the borrowed funds into income-producing assets (shares, ETFs, property trusts, investment property)
4. Claim interest on investment loan as a tax deduction
5. Use investment income + tax savings to repeat the cycle

**Key benefit:** You're simultaneously:
- Paying off your home faster
- Building an investment portfolio
- Reducing your tax bill

**Requirements:**
- Must have a home with equity (owner-occupier debt to convert)
- Investment must produce assessable income (rent, dividends)
- Long-term strategy — works over 10-20+ years
- Needs income protection insurance + emergency fund as safeguards

**PropPath relevance:** Could be a Phase 1→2 strategy visualisation. Show clients how their PPOR equity converts into portfolio equity over time.

## 2. Manufacturing Equity (Equity Acceleration)

**What it is:** Forcing property value growth rather than waiting for natural market appreciation.

**Methods:**
- **Renovation:** Cosmetic or structural improvements that add more value than they cost
- **Subdivision:** Splitting land to create additional titles/dwellings
- **Development:** Building new dwellings on existing land (granny flat, duplex, townhouses)
- **Rezoning plays:** Buying in areas pre-rezoning, benefiting from uplift

**Why BAs use this:** Accelerates the equity leverage cycle. Instead of waiting 5-7 years for market growth, manufacture $100k+ in equity in 12-18 months, then refinance and buy again.

**Risk:** Renovation over-capitalisation (spend more than you add in value). Must know the suburb ceiling.

## 3. Ownership Structures

### Individual / Joint Names
- Simplest structure
- CGT discount available (50% if held 12+ months)
- Negative gearing offsets personal income

### Family Trust (Discretionary Trust)
- **Pros:** Income splitting across family members, asset protection, flexibility in distributing gains
- **Cons:** Cannot negative gear (losses stay in trust, can't offset personal income), setup and ongoing costs
- Best for: positive cash flow portfolios, high-net-worth clients protecting assets

### Company
- 30% flat tax rate (25% for small base companies)
- No CGT discount
- Rarely used for buy-and-hold property
- Better for: development/trading strategies

### SMSF (Self-Managed Super Fund)
- 15% tax rate in accumulation phase
- 0% tax in pension phase
- Can borrow via LRBA (Limited Recourse Borrowing Arrangement)
- Restrictions: can't renovate with borrowed funds, must be "investment quality" property
- Best for: later-stage investors approaching retirement

**PropPath relevance:** Clients may hold properties across multiple structures. PropPath should be able to show a portfolio across entities, not just individual names.

## 4. Rentvesting

**What it is:** Renting where you want to live, buying investment property where the numbers work.

**Why it's popular:** Allows investors to enter the market in high-growth suburbs without needing to live there. PPORs in Sydney/Melbourne are often poor investment assets.

**Trade-offs:**
- No CGT discount on PPOR (since they don't own one)
- Psychological: renting feels less "stable" for some clients
- Flexibility: can buy in best-opportunity markets regardless of where you live

## 5. The BRRRR Method

**Buy → Renovate → Rent → Refinance → Repeat**

1. **Buy** undervalued or cosmetically distressed property
2. **Renovate** to increase value and rental appeal
3. **Rent** at market rate (improves serviceability)
4. **Refinance** at new (higher) valuation — extract equity
5. **Repeat** — use extracted equity as deposit for next property

**Why it's powerful:** In theory, can cycle the same capital through multiple purchases. Each cycle leaves the investor with a tenanted property with minimal cash left in.

**Risk:** Relies on valuations going up. Over-renovation, poor suburb selection, or rising interest rates can break the cycle.

## 6. Equity Stacking / Co-Investment (Emerging 2026 Trend)

- Investors are layering junior and senior capital
- Syndicating deals (multiple investors pooling into one purchase)
- Partnering with funds to scale holdings without over-leveraging
- Platform-based debt solutions filling gaps where banks won't lend

**PropPath relevance:** Future feature — could PropPath model shared/syndicated portfolio scenarios?

## Key Strategic Insight for PropPath

**The portfolio journey is a CYCLE, not a line:**

Buy → Grow → Leverage → Buy → Grow → Leverage → [Manufacture if needed] → Buy...

PropPath should visualise:
1. The equity extraction moments (when can client buy again?)
2. The "manufacture equity" opportunities (when does a reno make sense?)
3. The structure decision points (when to move into trust/SMSF?)
4. The consolidation phase (when to sell down and shift to commercial)

**The alert feature Gameplans has ("Sarah has enough equity for her next purchase") is a CRITICAL PropPath feature.**
