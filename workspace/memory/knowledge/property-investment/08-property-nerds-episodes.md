## Key Intel from RSS Feed (Feb 24 2026 episode — latest)

Full description of most recent episode:
> "Major banks are tightening trust and company lending, following regulatory pressure from APRA. Longstanding strategies built on 'endless borrowing' are rapidly disappearing. Macquarie Bank helped fuel aggressive trust lending in recent years — now being quietly wound back. New AML rules will add layers of administration, cost, and complexity to trust lending. Non-bank lenders stepping in as major banks retreat. Brokers now facilitate close to 80% of Australian lending. Having an investment-specialist finance team has become non-negotiable for portfolio builders."

**PropPath relevance:** This is the kind of regulatory shift that affects WHEN a client can buy next. PropPath's roadmap should be able to show "serviceability ceiling" — when a client hits their borrowing limit — as a stage milestone.

## What The Property Nerds Content Tells Us About IK's Clients

The episode topics reveal what IK clients worry about most:
1. **"Can I borrow more?"** — Borrowing capacity is a recurring pain point
2. **"When do I go commercial?"** — Stage 3 transition is a live conversation
3. **"Am I picking the right market?"** — Data anxiety; need validation
4. **"What is the media getting wrong?"** — Counter-cyclical mindset, trust in IK data over headlines
5. **"How do I scale faster?"** — 2M+ borrowing, sight unseen, multi-state

All five of these are things PropPath's living roadmap can address visually.
