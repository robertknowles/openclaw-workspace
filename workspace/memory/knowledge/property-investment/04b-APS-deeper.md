## School of Property (schoolofproperty.com.au)

APS's education arm — launched ~2023, significant expansion in 2024.

**What it is:**
- Paid education program designed by Sam Gordon
- Curriculum for beginners AND advanced investors
- "Success in property investing isn't about luck or guesswork — it's about having the right knowledge, strategy, and execution at every step"
- Covers: fundamentals, proven blueprint, advanced strategies, "tools to futureproof your success"

**Client outcomes from School of Property (testimonials):**
- Bailey: Built 3-property portfolio from $60k equity in 12 months → $480k equity created
- Adam & Kerry: $530k equity, portfolio worth $2.136M in 12 months
- Nathan & Katelyn: 5 properties in 12 months, $2.5M portfolio

**Key insight:** School of Property is the education layer BEFORE or alongside the BA service. It's separate from acquisition — it's about mindset + strategy understanding. PropPath is the *ongoing tracking* layer that sits AFTER the strategy session.

## APS's Advanced Portfolio Thinking

From Scouting Australia podcast (Jan 2026 episode on mistakes):
### Top Investor Mistakes (APS perspective)
1. A more expensive property isn't automatically a better investment
2. Impatience — this is a long-term game
3. Not having a strategy before buying
4. Letting others talk you out of what you can achieve
5. Cash flow OR bread and butter — false choice (need both interleaved)
6. Following the herd

### The "Buy & Hold Myth" (2024 recap episode)
- APS position: pure buy & hold is NOT enough
- You must actively manage: market selection, portfolio composition, equity recycling
- "Strategic portfolio building" includes knowing when to transition to commercial
- Eventually, residential cash flow alone may plateau — commercial is the next phase

### Selling Strategy (when APS says sell)
- Picking the right agent for off-market sales
- "The art and challenge of exiting markets" — know when a market has run its cycle
- Selling is a strategic tool, not a failure
- Triggered by: market cycle completion, equity redeployment opportunity, portfolio rebalancing

### Commercial Transition
- After building a residential portfolio, APS clients increasingly move to commercial
- Commercial = higher yields, longer leases, different serviceability
- "Strategic portfolio building: commercial transition" — a full episode topic
- PropPath implication: the roadmap should accommodate residential → commercial evolution

### Market Dynamics (2024/2025)
- Stock quality and yield changing across markets
- Macro: inflation, cash rate, market outlook = active monitoring required
- Construction crisis = less new supply = supports existing property values

## PropPath Opportunity from APS Research

APS has an **education product** (School of Property) and a **BA service** (acquisition). What they DON'T have:
- A living portfolio dashboard clients can return to between purchases
- Automated tracking of equity growth vs projections
- Visual "where am I in the roadmap" for clients
- Scenario modelling: "what if I buy THIS property next?"
- Milestone notifications: "you've hit the equity threshold for purchase 3"

**The gap:** APS builds the strategy → APS buys the property → then clients are largely on their own until they're ready for the next one. PropPath fills the between-purchases phase.
