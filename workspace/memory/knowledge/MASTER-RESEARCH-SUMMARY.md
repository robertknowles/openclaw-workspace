## 1. THE MARKET CONTEXT

### The Australian Buyers Agency Landscape
- ~5,000+ registered BAs in Australia (growing fast post-COVID)
- Top agencies are scaling hard: InvestorKit $7.6M → $15M → forecast $25M in 3 years
- Average client buys 3+ properties over 3–5 years
- The BA relationship is ongoing — not transactional. Value is in the lifecycle, not the deal.

### The Planning Problem BAs Have Today
Every BA does portfolio planning. None have the right tool for it.

Current state:
- **Gameplans** — used in live sessions to show a 30-year simulation. BA-only. Session-time tool. Clients never see it again.
- **Spreadsheets** — manual, break constantly, not client-facing
- **PDFs / Word docs** — static, outdated the moment they're printed
- **The BA's head** — the most common "system" — no record, no alerts, no client access

The gap: **no tool exists that keeps the portfolio plan alive between BA sessions and gives the client ongoing visibility.**

---

## 2. THE TWO PLANNING MODELS (Critical to Understand)

### Model A: Simulation-First (Gameplans)
- Build a full 30-year projection upfront
- Show client the end-state: "your portfolio will be worth $X with $Y passive income in 2034"
- Primary use: conversion tool in live sales sessions
- Weakness: static, not updated with reality, client never has independent access

### Model B: Incremental, BA-Guided (InvestorKit)
- Build the plan one property at a time, grounded in current real numbers
- Monthly reviews keep the plan current
- Each acquisition is a fresh decision — not a pre-scripted step in a simulation
- Strength: real numbers, real decisions, real outcomes

**PropPath is aligned to Model B — incremental, not simulation-first.**

This is the most important product calibration decision. PropPath is a living navigation tool (updates as you move), not a route preview (shows you the destination before you leave).

## 3. THE TARGET CUSTOMER — IN DEPTH

### InvestorKit (Primary Target)

**Who they are:**
- $15M revenue, ~80 staff, 1,200+ clients, REB BA of Year 2x running
- Growing to $25M in FY26 — scaling fast, client volume increasing
- Founded by Arjun Paliwal (ex-CBA, left at 26 with 9 properties)

**How they work:**
- Private banking model: Portfolio Strategist owns client relationship
- Team structure: Strategist → Research → Acquisitions → Client Success
- Buys in 9–15 markets simultaneously, national/remote
- Rejects 92% of properties — only 8% pass due diligence

**Their portfolio framework:**
1. **Foundation** — blue chip capital city assets, equity building
2. **Momentum** — affordable, nationwide, data-driven, leverage foundation equity
3. **Passive** — commercial + unit blocks, cash flow, financial independence

**Their lifecycle cycle (per property):**
- **Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate** — repeats for every purchase

**The client journey:**
- Entry: ~$100k usable equity, $525k min residential purchase
- Timeline: 1–4 months to first purchase
- Annual reviews (FAQ confirmed baseline)
- Monthly reviews for active clients (job posting language)
- "Most clients get 3 properties in 3 years"

**Their planning tool:**
- Portfolio Mapping Session = their core product
- Uses Gameplans internally (branded as "Portfolio Wealth Accelerator" — a now-dead campaign page)
- Produces a forward-looking roadmap with retirement income projections
- BUT: it's human-delivered. No client portal. No self-service. No live updates between sessions.

**The PropPath pitch to InvestorKit:**
> "You're doing portfolio mapping manually in sessions. PropPath turns that into a living client dashboard. Your Portfolio Strategists spend less time on monthly reviews and more time on high-value strategy. Your clients get peace of mind between sessions."

### Australian Property Scout / School of Property (Secondary Target)

**APS Business:**
- Sam Gordon: 84 individual properties, $48M+ portfolio
- Buyer's agency focused on below-market, cash flow + growth deals
- Awards: REB BA of Year 2024

**APS's Trident Formula (confirmed):**
Three prongs — ALL must be present for a deal to qualify:
1. **Below market value** (buy at discount — manufactured equity from day one)
2. **Strong cash flow** (yield sufficient to hold)
3. **Capital growth + value-add potential** (suburb fundamentals + improvement opportunity)

This is a deal-qualification filter, not a portfolio stage framework. It answers "is this the right property?" at each stage.

**APS Deal Types (3 flavours):**
1. **Bread & Butter** — below market, cash flow positive, solid growth (the signature APS deal)
2. **Cash Flow** — maximum yield, used when serviceability is tight
3. **Manufactured Equity** — renovation/add value play, fastest equity creation

**School of Property (education arm):**
- 11 modules, 70+ lessons, 50+ hours of video (live Kajabi page, Feb 2026)
- Platform: Kajabi (schoolofproperty.mykajabi.com)
- Lifetime access
- Core framework: The Trident Formula + module sequence from fundamentals → scaling
- 9 confirmed module names (see `04b-aps-deep-dive.md`)

**PropPath opportunity with APS:**
- APS clients learn the strategy from School of Property
- PropPath is the execution layer — the living tool students use after they've learned the blueprint
- BA + client portal maps perfectly to APS's education → execution model

## 4. THE COMPETITOR — GAMEPLANS

**What it is:** Visual portfolio modelling tool used by BAs in live sessions. 30-year simulation engine. BA-facing only.

**What it does well:**
- Side-by-side scenario comparison (residential vs commercial, 2 properties vs 1)
- Visual equity-growth charts
- Equity trigger alert ("Sarah can afford her next property")
- Session-time engagement — makes BAs look credible in sales meetings

**What it doesn't do:**
- Client-facing portal (no ongoing client access)
- Living roadmap (not updated with real property performance)
- Milestone tracking between purchases
- Automated equity alerts to clients
- Deal type sequencing recommendations
- Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate lifecycle tracking

**Gameplans' role:** It's a **conversion tool** — used to close clients, not to retain them.
**PropPath's role:** It's a **retention + lifecycle tool** — used to keep clients engaged for the full 5–10 year journey.

These aren't substitutes. BAs could use both. But PropPath fills the gap Gameplans explicitly does not.

## 5. THE PROPPATH PRODUCT — WHAT IT IS

### One Sentence
**PropPath is the living portfolio roadmap that sits between the BA and the client — the plan that persists between sessions, tracks progress, and triggers the next move.**

### The 6 Core MVP Features

1. **Portfolio Roadmap Builder** — visual, step-by-step portfolio plan from current position → income goal (BA builds, client views)
2. **Goal Reverse-Engineering Engine** — client sets "$100k passive income by 2035" → system calculates how many properties, at what yield, in what timeframe
3. **Current Portfolio Dashboard** — live view of client's portfolio: properties, equity, LVR, cash flow, total value
4. **Equity Trigger Alerts** — automatically alerts BA + client when equity is ready for next purchase
5. **Milestone Tracker** — planned vs. actual progress: "Property 2 planned Q3 2024, achieved Q1 2025"
6. **Dual BA/Client Portal** — BA builds + manages, client has their own ongoing read-access view

### Priority V1 Features (on top of MVP)
- Borrowing capacity tracker (serviceability ceiling warning)
- Deal type sequencing (recommends B&B vs cash flow vs manufactured equity based on position)
- Cash flow projection (forward portfolio-level cash flow)
- Equity growth chart (per property + portfolio)
- Scenario modelling / "what if" tool
- Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate cycle tracker per property

## 6. THE CLIENT EMOTIONAL JOURNEY (What PropPath Solves)

Based on IK case studies and podcast content, here's the emotional arc of BA clients:

1. **Confusion/Overwhelm** — too many suburbs, conflicting advice, don't know where to start
2. **First purchase relief** — "I've finally done it"
3. **Impatience** — waiting for equity, wanting to buy again, not sure if they're on track
4. **Milestone clarity** — "I can see the plan now, I know what next looks like"
5. **Confidence** — repeat purchases feel easier
6. **Peace of mind** — "I know I'm on track for retirement"

**PropPath addresses stages 3–6.** The BA handles stages 1–2. The living dashboard is what transforms impatience and anxiety into clarity and confidence.

Ryan & Lauren (IK case study) captures the end-state perfectly:
> *"They no longer feel like retirement is an open question. They know time is now working in their favour."*

**That feeling is what PropPath delivers — not in a session, but every time a client opens the app.**

---

## 7. THE PROPERTY NERDS — WHAT IT TELLS US

IK's podcast topics reveal what their clients are worried about:
1. **"Can I borrow more?"** — serviceability is recurring pain point
2. **"When do I go commercial?"** — stage 3 transition is live
3. **"Am I picking the right market?"** — data validation anxiety
4. **"What is the media getting wrong?"** — counter-cyclical thinking
5. **"How do I scale faster?"** — multi-state, sight unseen, $2M+ portfolios

Latest episode (Feb 24, 2026): APRA tightening trust/company lending, AML complexity, non-bank lenders filling void. **PropPath should eventually show a "serviceability ceiling" milestone** — when a client's borrowing structure needs to change.

## 8. KEY STRATEGIC INSIGHTS (Carry Into Product + GTM)

### On the Product
- PropPath must feel like **live navigation, not a brochure**. The moment it becomes static, it loses its reason to exist.
- The equity trigger alert is **the single most retention-valuable feature**. The moment a client gets a "you're ready to buy again" notification, the BA is re-engaged instantly.
- The dual portal (BA + client view) is the **#1 competitive differentiator vs Gameplans**. Gameplans will never do this — their business model is BA-only.
- The Acquire → Optimise → Consolidate cycle tracker maps directly to how IK operates. Build this into the roadmap view — it will resonate deeply with IK-style BAs.

### On the Target Customer
- **InvestorKit is the perfect first customer**: they already believe in portfolio planning, they already use a tool (Gameplans), they're scaling fast (more clients = more reviews = more pain), and their whole brand is data-driven.
- **APS clients use a deal-first framework** (Trident Formula) — PropPath doesn't replace that. It sits on top of it, showing HOW the deal fits the client's portfolio stage and long-term goal.
- **School of Property creates warm leads** — students learn the strategy, then need a tool to execute. PropPath is the natural next step after completing the course.

### On Positioning
- Don't position against Gameplans directly. They solve a different problem (conversion). Position against the **gap after Gameplans** — the 6-24 months between sessions where the client is invisible.
- The headline: **"Your portfolio plan, alive."**
- The problem statement: **"BAs close clients with a plan. But after the session, that plan disappears. PropPath keeps it alive."**

### On Go-To-Market
- Start with 2–3 BAs who are already InvestorKit-style operators (monthly reviews, multi-property clients, frustrated with Gameplans' limitations)
- School of Property students are a warm audience for a PropPath freemium/self-serve tier
- The Property Nerds podcast topics (borrowing capacity, commercial transition, market data) = exact features that should be in PropPath's roadmap view

## 9. OPEN QUESTIONS (Not Yet Researched)

These are the gaps remaining after the research phase:

**Product:**
- What does Gameplans' pricing look like for BAs? (needed for PropPath pricing strategy)
- Does Gameplans have any client-facing features we don't know about?
- What does the Gameplans output PDF/screen actually look like? (need to see it)

**Market:**
- Who else are the top 10 investment-focused BAs in Australia beyond IK and APS?
- Cohen Handler, Property Maverick, Metropole, Empower Wealth — what tools do they use?
- Are there any other portfolio planning tools in the market we haven't found?

**Go-To-Market:**
- What is the right pricing model? Per BA seat? Per client seat? Flat SaaS?
- What is the right first market — Sydney BAs? National? IK specifically?
- What does the PropPath sales motion look like? Demo → pilot → paid?

## 10. RESEARCH PHASE VERDICT

**What we know with high confidence:**
- The problem is real and unsolved — no client-facing living portfolio tool exists
- InvestorKit is the ideal first customer archetype
- The 6 MVP features are correct and validated against real BA workflows
- The incremental model (not simulation-first) is the right product premise
- The equity trigger alert is the single highest-value feature to ship first

**What we know with medium confidence:**
- Gameplans is the primary competitor — but it's a session tool, not a lifecycle tool
- APS/School of Property represents a warm distribution channel
- The PropPath pitch to BAs is: "keep your clients engaged between purchases"

**What still needs validation:**
- Pricing
- The full competitive landscape beyond IK/APS/Gameplans
- Whether BAs will pay for a client-facing tool (vs keeping it BA-only like Gameplans)
