## Gap Analysis (After First Research Block)

### Known Gaps to Fill Next
1. **Gameplans Pricing** — need exact subscription pricing tiers
2. **REBAA / PIPA membership data** — how many licensed BAs in Australia, regulatory landscape
3. **BA business model deep dive** — how much do BAs earn? What's a typical fee structure?
4. **PropPath differentiation** — need to formally map where PropPath wins vs Gameplans
5. **Software adoption barriers** — what stops BAs from adopting new tools?
6. **Client acquisition model** — how do BAs find clients? What marketing works for them?
7. **Seasonal patterns** — when do investors buy (timing of strategy sessions)?

## Key Findings Summary

### Most Critical Insights
1. **Gameplans is the direct competitor** — already in 400+ BA firms, 4.8 stars, PIPA partnership
2. **Spreadsheets are the real enemy** — every BA uses them; this is the pain to solve
3. **BAs want to be heroes to clients** — they'll pay for tools that make them look good
4. **"Covers itself with the first client"** — this is the right pricing frame
5. **Equity notification is a killer feature** — knowing when a client can buy again = retention
6. **White-labelling** — Gameplans offers this. PropPath should consider it
7. **The full lifecycle is not served** — strategy → acquisition → portfolio management is fragmented
