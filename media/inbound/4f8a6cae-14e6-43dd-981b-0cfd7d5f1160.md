# Project Specification: Mission Control Dashboard

**Author:** Manus AI  
**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Vision

To build a local, single-page web application that serves as a "Mission Control" dashboard. This dashboard will provide a visual interface for a non-technical user to manage, monitor, and collaborate with an AI agent (OpenClaw/Bertie). It replaces text-based chat with a structured, persistent command center, enabling the development of a comprehensive, AI-powered business operating system.

### 1.2. Core Objective

The primary goal is for you, OpenClaw, to build this application for the user. This project will serve as the foundational test of your capabilities as a "technical cofounder." The application must be built to run locally on the user's macOS machine, with all data stored on the local file system.

## 2. Technical Stack & Architecture

### 2.1. Recommended Technology Stack

- **Framework:** React with Vite
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** Shadcn/UI (for pre-built, accessible components like buttons, tabs, and cards)
- **Icons:** Lucide React

This stack is chosen for its modern development experience, performance, and ease of creating a clean, professional user interface without complex setup.

### 2.2. Application Architecture

- **Structure:** A single-page application (SPA).
- **Project Setup:** Initialize a new Vite + React + TypeScript project.
- **Data Flow:** The application will read from and write to local JSON files for all its data. There is no backend server or database required.

### 2.3. Data Storage

- **Location:** All application data must be stored within a new `mission_control_data` directory located at `~/Documents/openclaw/mission_control_data/`.
- **Format:** Use separate JSON files for different data models (e.g., `tasks.json`, `activity_log.json`, `lead_gen.json`, `research.json`, `outreach.json`, `tech_dev.json`, `marketing.json`).
- **Mechanism:** Use Node.js's `fs` module (or an equivalent browser-compatible API if running in a pure front-end context that can access local files via a backend process you create) to read and write these files. The application should periodically check for updates and save changes automatically.

## 3. Application Structure

The application consists of one main dashboard and five primary tabs. Each tab follows a uniform structure to ensure consistency and scalability.

### 3.1. Main Dashboard (Home)

This is the central command center, providing an at-a-glance overview.

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Activity Log** | A reverse-chronological list of all actions taken by you (the AI). Each entry should have a timestamp and a concise description (e.g., "`[2026-02-15 10:30:00]` Started research on competitor X."). |
| **Kanban Board** | A three-column task board (`To Do`, `In Progress`, `For Review`). Tasks should be represented as cards that can be dragged between columns. Each card should have a title and a short description. |
| **Daily Briefing** | A summary of significant activities and findings completed since the user's last session. This should be generated automatically based on recent activity log entries. |
| **Action Required** | A dedicated section highlighting questions or decisions that require the user's input or approval. Each item should be a clickable link that navigates to the relevant context within the app. |

### 3.2. Uniform Tab Structure

Each of the five tabs will follow this exact structure. This ensures consistency and makes it easy to add custom features to specific tabs later.

| Section | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Past Work** | A chronological log of completed tasks and activities for this domain. Each entry should have a date, title, and brief description. |
| **Present Work** | A list of tasks currently in progress for this domain. Display as cards with status indicators. |
| **Future Work** | A list of planned tasks or goals for this domain. Users should be able to add new items here. |
| **Feedback: What We Like** | A section where the user can record positive feedback on work completed in this domain. Display as a list of user-submitted notes. |
| **Feedback: What We Don't Like** | A section where the user can record negative feedback or areas for improvement. Display as a list of user-submitted notes. |
| **Skills & APIs Connected** | A static display panel showing which tools, APIs, and capabilities are available and connected for this domain (e.g., "LinkedIn API: Connected", "Web Scraping: Active"). |
| **Knowledge Base** | A viewer for relevant documentation, notes, and resources specific to this domain. This should read Markdown files from a subdirectory within the data folder (e.g., `~/Documents/openclaw/mission_control_data/knowledge_base/lead_gen/`). |

## 4. The Five Tabs

### 4.1. Tab 1: Lead Generation

**Purpose:** Map out every available lead in the target industry.

**Priority:** High (immediate focus)

**Custom Features (to be added later):**
- Interactive industry map visualization
- Searchable/filterable lead database
- Lead scoring system

### 4.2. Tab 2: Research Expert

**Purpose:** Centralized repository for product knowledge, industry intelligence, and strategic advice.

**Priority:** High (immediate focus)

**Custom Features (to be added later):**
- Advanced search across all knowledge base documents
- Competitive analysis dashboard
- Market trend tracking

### 4.3. Tab 3: Outreach & Results

**Purpose:** Manage LinkedIn outreach campaigns and track results.

**Priority:** High (immediate focus)

**Custom Features (to be added later):**
- Campaign management interface
- Response rate analytics
- Message template library with A/B testing

### 4.4. Tab 4: Tech Development

**Purpose:** Product development, code review, bug tracking, and security monitoring.

**Priority:** Low (will be implemented in a few weeks)

**Custom Features (to be added later):**
- GitHub integration showing open issues and recent commits
- Code review approval workflow
- Security vulnerability scanner results

### 4.5. Tab 5: Marketing & Content

**Purpose:** Content strategy, marketing campaigns, and brand management.

**Priority:** Low (will be implemented in a few weeks)

**Custom Features (to be added later):**
- Content calendar
- Social media performance metrics
- Brand asset library

## 5. Implementation Plan

Build this application in logical phases, focusing on the high-priority tabs first.

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Core UI

Initialize the Vite + React + TypeScript project, set up Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/UI components, and build the main application shell with sidebar navigation and the five empty tabs.

### Phase 2: Main Dashboard

Create the JSON file structures for data storage. Implement the Main Dashboard components (Activity Log, Kanban Board, Daily Briefing, Action Required), focusing on reading and displaying data from the local JSON files.

### Phase 3: Uniform Tab Template

Build the uniform tab structure once as a reusable component. This component should accept props to customize which data file it reads from and which knowledge base subdirectory it displays.

### Phase 4: Implement High-Priority Tabs

Apply the uniform tab template to Tab 1 (Lead Generation), Tab 2 (Research Expert), and Tab 3 (Outreach & Results). Ensure all sections are functional and data is being saved/loaded correctly.

### Phase 5: Implement Low-Priority Tabs

Apply the uniform tab template to Tab 4 (Tech Development) and Tab 5 (Marketing & Content). These tabs will remain functional but unused until the user is ready to focus on them in a few weeks.

### Phase 6: Refinement & Polish

Polish the UI/UX, ensure responsive design, and verify all data persistence is working correctly. Add any final touches to improve usability.

## 6. Final Instructions

Your task is to execute this specification. You should provide the user with regular updates on your progress, ideally by populating the "Activity Log" of the Mission Control dashboard itself as you build it. Ask clarifying questions if any part of this specification is unclear.

**Start with Phase 1.** Build the foundation first, then iterate. The user wants to see progress incrementally, not wait for a complete product.

Good luck.
