You're right on 1 and 2 — I modelled the wrong user. I was imagining a client sitting at the keyboard. The BA builds the plan, then presents a finished story. That changes the critique completely. My bad.

The inputs being prominent makes total sense for the BA workflow — they need to tweak in real time when a client pushes back. "You wanted a house? Let me change that right now and show you why the unit wins on every metric." That's actually a powerful sales move and the tool supports it well.

Standing my ground on one thing you didn't rebut: "Next Buy Window." Even in the BA-led workflow, the annual AVAIL row is sitting right there and nobody's surfacing it as an insight. A callout that says "Next purchase window: 2027" gives the BA a reason to call the client back. That's pipeline for the BA, not just planning. Worth 2 hours of dev time.

Fully defer on the rest. Ready to move — where do you want to start? Retirement snapshot UI, numbers audit, or the borrowing calculator dead-end?

Here is roadmap lite. I was very pleased with how similar are products are- because they are actually from the industry. 
I dont love there output- its not that clear.
But anyway, we are looking at metrics, etc to try audit against ours
Make notes and save

Got all 6. Reading carefully now — there's some really important stuff here for the numbers audit. Saving everything.

By the way. This isnt necessarily a proven product. Its a tool that this Investor Agency uses for to capture leads for there agency. Gameplans is a legit standalone business. Just a slightly different model

And gameplans is proven- but complex in its quite different- its really expensive and they deploy themselves as consultants to work for BAs and use there complicated software
So you can see the gap we are trying to slide into

Crystal clear. The gap makes total sense now:

Roadmap Lite — internal lead gen tool, not for sale, not proven as a product
Gameplans — proven but expensive, complex, requires consultants to deploy it. BAs aren't buying software, they're buying a service wrapped around software
PropPath — self-serve, BA-owned, no consultant needed, affordable

You're going after BAs who want Gameplans-level output but can't justify the cost or the dependency on someone else running it for them. That's a real gap and it's the right one.

The implication for the fixes is also clearer now: PropPath doesn't need to out-feature Gameplans. It needs to be credible enough that a BA feels confident presenting it to a client without a consultant in the room. That's why the financial rigor gaps (DTI, LVR, vacancy) matter so much — if a client asks "is this realistic?" the BA needs to be able to say yes with confidence.

Ready to start on the four fixes whenever you are. Want to go one at a time so you can test each one, or should I do all four in one pass?
Still here, getting everything. Discord is just being flaky on your end — all your messages are arriving fine.

To confirm where we landed: ready to execute the four fixes. One at a time or all in one pass — your call.

I dont want to implement any fixes. I am just trying research with you. How did you go saving the investor kit details and screenshots?

Saved so far this session:
✅ roadmap-lite-competitive-analysis.md — full competitor breakdown from your 6 screenshots

What I didn't save yet — the PropPath UI map from your first 12 screenshots. I read all the code files but never wrote the document. Doing that now.
rob — 7:32 PM
You did Im pretty sure? I thought I read the PropPath one. And your saying you did the Roadmap one. Do you want to save the images or dont need them?

All done. Here's what's saved:

Documents:
proppath-ui-map.md — every screen to code file
roadmap-lite-competitive-analysis.md — full competitor breakdown
HANDOFF.md — full session state for next time

Screenshots:
12 PropPath screenshots — named and organised
6 Roadmap Lite screenshots — named and organised

Start a /new session and I'll pick up exactly where we left off. Good session Rob.
